{"text":"China, respiratory manifestations of the disease have been observed. However, as a fatal comorbidity, acute myocardial injury (AMI) in COVID-19 patients has not been previously investigated in detail. We investigated the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients with AMI and determined the risk factors for AMI in them. We analyzed data from 53 consecutive laboratory-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients (28 men, 25 women; age, 19-81 years). We collected information on epidemiological and demographic characteristics, clinical features, routine laboratory tests (including cardiac injury biomarkers), echocardiography, electrocardiography, imaging findings, management methods, and clinical outcomes. Results: Cardiac complications were found in 42 of the 53 (79.25%) patients: tachycardia (n=15), electrocardiography abnormities (n=11), diastolic dysfunction (n=20), elevated myocardial enzymes (n=30), and AMI (n=6). All the six AMI patients were aged >60 years; five of them had two or more underlying comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) severity was higher in the AMI patients than in patients with non-definite AMI (p<0.001). All the AMI patients required care in intensive care unit; of them, three died, two remain hospitalized. Multivariate analyses showed that C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, NCP severity, and underlying comorbidities were the risk factors for cardiac abnormalities in COVID-19 patients.

Methods: A total of 85 hospitalized patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 in Beijing You'an Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. According to liver function, they were divided into ALT normal group (n=52) and ALT elevation group (n=33). Clinical features and laboratory data were compared between the two groups. The independent risk factors for liver injury were analyzed. Results: There were 33 patients with hepatic injury in our study, accounting for 38.8% (33\/85). The patients in ALT elevation group were older than those in ALT normal group. The levels of lactic acid, CRP, myoglobin, and neutrophils were significantly higher in ALT elevation group. The lymphocytes and albumin were significantly lower in ALT elevation group. The proportion of severe and critical patients in ALT elevation group was significantly higher. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed CRP \u2265 20 mg\/L and lymphocyte count< 1.1\u00d710^9\/L were independently related to hepatic injury.

Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an 51 important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these 52 interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma 53 has not yet been explored. This study aims to determine the levels of the IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, 54 IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association 55 between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, 56 a case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University 57 Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided 58 into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 59 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 60 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 61 (ELISA). 62 There was no significant correlation between the IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 levels and the lesions size 63 and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly correlated with 64 that.

Methods: Cases were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and were analysed for demographic, clinical, laboratory and radiological features. Of 198 patients, the median duration from disease onset to hospital admission was 4 days. The mean age of the patients was 50.1 years, and 51.0% patients were male. The most common symptom was fever. Less than half of the patients presented with respiratory systems including cough, sputum production, itchy or sore throat, shortness of breath, and chest congestion. 5.6% patients had diarrhoea. On admission, T lymphocytes were decreased in 45.8% patients. Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction. Compared with patients not treated in ICU, patients treated in the ICU were older, had longer waiting time to admission, fever over 38.5 o C, dyspnoea, reduced T lymphocytes, elevated neutrophils and organ failure. In this single centre cohort of COVID-19 patients, the most common symptom was fever, and the most common laboratory abnormality was decreased blood T cell counts. Older age, male, fever over 38.5 o C, symptoms of dyspnoea, and underlying comorbidity, were the risk factors most associated with severity of disease. Patients. We obtained epidemiological, demographic, clinical, laboratory and management data from the medical records of patients infected with SARS-Cov-2.

Since then all hospitals in Shanghai have opened special fever clinics to screen suspected patients, and laboratory confirmed patients were then admitted to a single designated hospital in Shanghai (Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was done by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Throat-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were obtained from all patients at admission and maintained in viral transport medium. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using the same protocol as described previously 3 . Confirmed patients were hospitalized into negative pressure wards for further medical observation and treatment. We collected data from patients who were admitted from Jan. 20 up to Feb. 15.

{"text":"Artificial nanoparticles accumulate a protein corona layer in biological fluids, which significantly influences their bioactivity. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b242), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies. doi: bioRxiv preprint HSV-1 is an example of another virus with high prevalence, infecting nearly 70% of the human population 17 .

It is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1101\/246785 doi: bioRxiv preprint 4 sensory neurons and establishes latency 19 . Latent HSV-1 is occasionally reactivated causing peripheral pathology and under certain circumstances it can migrate into the central nervous system causing herpes simplex encephalitis; the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis 19 . In the context of the current work we focused on the presumptive role of HSV-1 in the pathology of AD. A number of risk factors have been associated with AD, including the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), diabetes, vascular pathology, neuroinflammation and infections 20 . Several recent studies have supported the theory of a significant role of HSV-1 in the disease 21 . HSV-1 DNA was found to be localized within amyloid plaques in AD patients and HSV-1 infection has been shown to promote neurotoxic A\u03b2 accumulation in human neural cells and to the formation of A\u03b2 deposits in the brains of infected mice 22,23 . Moreover, the presence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies, which indicate HSV reactivation, is correlated with a high risk of AD and antiherpetic treatment is correlated with a reduced risk of developing dementia 24,25 . Despite these correlations, the mechanism by which viruses induce amyloid aggregation, the major pathological hallmark of AD, is not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that upon encountering different biological fluids, RSV accumulated extensive and distinct protein coronae compared to HSV-1 and synthetic liposomes. The various coronae were dependent on the biological fluid and exerted markedly different effects on RSV infectivity and capacity to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Moreover, upon interaction with an amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP, RSV accelerated the process of amyloid aggregation via surface-assisted heterogenous nucleation. This amyloid catalysis was also demonstrated for HSV-1 and the A\u03b242 peptide in-vitro and in an AD animal model. Our findings highlight the importance of viral protein corona interactions for viral pathogenesis and provide a direct mechanistic link between viral and amyloid pathologies. Results Based on the extensive literature describing the significant role of corona factors in synthetic nanoparticle functionality, we used established techniques to answer questions regarding RSV pathogenicity 26 . Using proteomics, we assessed the RSV protein corona profiles in adult human plasma (HP), juvenile (6 months old infants tested RSV negative at the time of sample collection) human plasma (jHP), human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from healthy adults, rhesus macaque plasma (MP), and fetal bovine serum (FBS). These biological fluids represent different microenvironments encountered by the virus in terms of tissue tropism (HP vs. BALF), zoonosis (MP) and culturing conditions (FBS). The biological fluids were screened for antibodies against RSV using ELISA, and both adult HP and BALF contained high levels of anti-RSV IgG antibodies, unlike jHP, MP and FBS (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Viral stocks were produced in serum-free conditions to prevent initial contamination with FBS proteins. Virions produced under serum-free conditions were incubated with 10% v\/v solutions of different biological fluids. Controls included non-infected cell medium representing the background cellular secretome, and synthetic lipid vesicles of a size comparable to RSV (200 nm) with positively or negatively charged surfaces. In addition, we compared the coronae of RSV to HSV-1 to probe for differences between different viruses of relatively similar size. After incubation for 1 h at 37 \u02daC, the virions were re-harvested by centrifugation and washed twice before performing mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. Six replicates from two independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software. The detection of specific anti-RSV IgG antibodies in biological fluids was performed using Human Anti-Respiratory syncytial virus IgG ELISA Kit (ab108765, abcam\u00ae, Sweden), according to manufacturer's protocol. All biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg\/ml before performing the assay and results were compared to the positive, cutoff, and negative controls provided by the kit manufacturer. HEp-2 cells were seeded in maintenance medium until they reached 50-60% confluency. On the day of infection, the cells were washed twice with warm PBS and medium was changed to VP-SFM with gentamycin. Before adding to the cells, sucrose cushion-concentrated RSV stocks were pre-incubated with different biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) at a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg\/ml in VP-SFM with 10 mM sodium citrate for 1 h at 37 \u02daC. The corona-precoated viruses were then added to the cells in serum-free conditions (diluted 10x) at a MOI of 1. 24h post-infection, the medium was changed back to growth medium and cells were visualized with fluorescence microscopy 72h post-infection. After visualization, the cells were washed and stained with LIVE\/DEAD\u2122 Fixable Far Red Dead Cell Stain Kit (ThermoFisher, USA) for 30 min at 4 \u02daC in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS no calcium, no magnesium, ThermoFisher), then fixed and washed for flow cytometry using Cytofix\/Cytoperm\u2122 (BD, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then scraped and resuspended in DPBS, and the data was acquired using MACSQuant\u00ae Analyser 10 flowcytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, Sweden). The data was analyzed by FlowJo software (TreeStar) by excluding the dead cells stained with far-red fluorescent dye and subsequent calculation of GFP positive cells within the viable cell population. For experiments with palivizumab, cells were treated with different concentrations of the antibody before infection. Human monocytes were negatively selected from buffy coats using the RosetteSep Monocyte Enrichment Kit (1mL\/10mL buffy coat; StemCell Technologies) and differentiated into moDC, using GM-CSF (250ng\/mL; PeproTech) and IL-4 (6.5ng\/mL; R&D Systems) for 6 days in 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 at a density of 5x10 5 cells\/mL in RPMI 1640 completed with 10% FCS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% and penicillin\/streptomycin (ThermoFisher, USA). Immature moDC were exposed to RSV pre-incubated with different biological fluids for 4h in serum free media, washed and then incubated in serum containing medium for 72 h before analyses of CD86 and RSV-GFP expression.

{"text":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease in infants. Other than age at the time of infection, the causes and correlates of severe illness in infants lacking known risk factors are poorly defined. We recruited a cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants and simultaneously assayed the presence of resident airway microbiota and the molecular status of their airways using a novel method. Rigorous statistical analyses identified a molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness dominated by excessive chemokine expression. Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses. All rights reserved.

{"text":"Background: Information on kidney impairment in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is limited. This study aims to assess the prevalence and impact of abnormal urine analysis and kidney dysfunction in hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan. We conducted a consecutive cohort study of COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary teaching hospital with 3 branches following a major outbreak in Wuhan in 2020. Hematuria, proteinuria, serum creatinine concentration and other clinical parameters were extracted from the electronic hospitalization databases and laboratory databases. Incidence rate for acute kidney injury (AKI) was examined during the study period. Association between kidney impairment and in-hospital death was analyzed. We included 710 consecutive COVID-19 patients, 89 (12.3%) of whom died in hospital. The median age of the patients was 63 years (inter quartile range, 51-71), including 374 men and 336 women. On admission, 44% of patients have proteinuria hematuria and 26.9% have hematuria, and the prevalence of elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen were 15.5% and 14.1% respectively. During the study period, AKI occurred in 3.2% patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with kidney impairment have higher risk for in-hospital death. Cox proportional hazard regression confirmed that elevated serum creatinine, elevated urea nitrogen, AKI, proteinuria and hematuria was an independent risk factor for in-hospital death after adjusting for age, sex, disease severity, leukocyte count and lymphocyte count.

Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion.

{"text":"Aging is a major risk factor for many neurodegenerative disorders. A key feature of aging biology that may underlie these diseases is cellular senescence. Senescent cells accumulate in tissues with age, undergo widespread changes in gene expression, and typically demonstrate altered, pro-inflammatory profiles. Astrocyte senescence has been implicated in neurodegenerative disease, and to better understand senescence-associated changes in astrocytes, we investigated changes in their transcriptome using RNA sequencing. Senescence was induced in human fetal astrocytes by transient oxidative stress. Brain-expressed genes, including those involved in neuronal development and differentiation, were downregulated in senescent astrocytes. Remarkably, several genes indicative of astrocytic responses to injury were also downregulated, including glial fibrillary acidic protein and genes involved in the processing and presentation of antigens by major histocompatibility complex class II proteins, while pro-inflammatory genes were upregulated. Overall, our findings suggest that senescence-related changes in the function of astrocytes may impact the pathogenesis of age-related brain disorders.","meta":{"paper_id":"4ea1d124972eda4c488d6446f88964f60bed47fc","title":"Changes in the Transcriptome of Human Astrocytes Accompanying Oxidative Stress-Induced Senescence"}}
{"text":"Hyponatremia can be a life-threatening illness among hospitalized children. The aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of hyponatremia in 3938 children who were admitted to the Cheil General Hospital and Women's Health Care Center with respiratory infections. Clinical data were collected, and multiplex RT-PCR analyses were done for various microorganisms. Hyponatremia was observed in 531 (13.5%) patients. The incidence of hyponatremia differed according to the respiratory tract infection (P < 0.0001) and microorganism (P = 0.001). In children with hyponatremia, the age at admission was significantly older (P < 0.0001), male gender was more frequent (P = 0.019), CRP was higher (P < 0.0001), and coinfection with multiple organisms was more common (P = 0.001) than in children without hyponatremia. In multivariate analyses, an older age at admission (P = 0.006), male gender (P = 0.004), and increased CRP (P < 0.0001) were independent risk factors. Sodium levels correlated negatively with WBC (P = 0.037), CRP (P < 0.0001), and number of hospital days (P = 0.020). The AUC values of age (0.586, P < 0.0001), CRP (0.599, P < 0.0001), and blood urea nitrogen (0.559, P < 0.0001) were all significant predictors of hyponatremia. This study is the first to show that the incidence of hyponatremia differs according to infecting microorganism and radiological findings. Hyponatremia is defined as a plasma sodium concentration of less than 135 mEq\/L and is one of the most common electrolyte derangements in both adults and children 1 . It can result from either a deficit of sodium or an excess of free water, and the incidence in a small number of cohorts was estimated as 17-45% of hospitalized children 2-5 . Acute, severe hyponatremia that develops within 48 hours can result in acute cerebral edema and various sequelae, such as headache, lethargy, seizures, and cardiac arrest due to brain stem herniation. Children are more vulnerable than adults to those sequelae because the brain\/intracranial volume ratio is higher in children than in adults 6-8 . Recent evidence suggests that even mild chronic hyponatremia can be related to subtle neurologic defects, such as impairments in balance and attention that can increase the incidence of falls 9 . The most probable cause of hyponatremia is thought to be the non-osmotic release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) as a result of various clinical conditions, such as fever, hypovolemia, and respiratory tract infections 2,4,10 . Among patients with respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and bronchiolitis are most commonly associated with hyponatremia 3-5 .

{"text":"HCV infection is a major risk factor for liver cancer and liver transplantation worldwide. Overstimulation of host lipid metabolism in the liver by HCV-encoded proteins during viral infection creates a favorable environment for virus propagation and pathogenesis. In this study, we hypothesize that targeting cellular enzymes acting as master regulators of lipid homeostasis could represent a powerful approach to developing a novel class of broad-spectrum antivirals against infection associated with human Flaviviridae viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), whose assembly and pathogenesis depend on interaction with lipid droplets (LDs). One such master regulator of cholesterol metabolic pathways is the host subtilisin\/kexin-isozyme-1 (SKI-1) -or site-1 protease (S1P). SKI-1\/S1P plays a critical role in the proteolytic activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs), which control expression of the key enzymes of cholesterol and fattyacid biosynthesis. Here we report the development of a SKI-1\/S1P-specific protein-based inhibitor and its application to blocking the SREBP signaling cascade. We demonstrate that SKI-1\/S1P inhibition effectively blocks HCV from establishing infection in hepatoma cells. The inhibitory mechanism is associated with a dramatic reduction in the abundance of neutral lipids, LDs, and the LD marker: adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP)\/perilipin 2. Reduction of LD formation inhibits virus assembly from infected cells. Importantly, we confirm that SKI-1\/S1P is a key host factor for HCV infection by using a specific active, site-directed, small-molecule inhibitor of SKI-1\/S1P: PF-429242. Our studies identify SKI-1\/S1P as both a novel regulator of the HCV lifecycle and as a potential host-directed therapeutic target against HCV infection and liver steatosis. With identification of an increasing number of human viruses that use host LDs for infection, our results suggest that SKI-1\/ S1P inhibitors may allow development of novel broad-spectrum biopharmaceuticals that could lead to novel indirect-acting antiviral options with the current standard of care.","meta":{"paper_id":"a447f42b4f4ed16afea798513f8c1409ee2252fa","title":"Human Subtilase SKI-1\/S1P Is a Master Regulator of the HCV Lifecycle and a Potential Host Cell Target for Developing Indirect-Acting Antiviral Agents"}}
{"text":"Background: When investigating covariate interactions and group associations with standard regression analyses, the relationship between the response variable and exposure may be difficult to characterize. When the relationship is nonlinear, linear modeling techniques do not capture the nonlinear information content. Statistical learning (SL) techniques with kernels are capable of addressing nonlinear problems without making parametric assumptions. However, these techniques do not produce findings relevant for epidemiologic interpretations. A simulated case-control study was used to contrast the information embedding characteristics and separation boundaries produced by a specific SL technique with logistic regression (LR) modeling representing a parametric approach. The SL technique was comprised of a kernel mapping in combination with a perceptron neural network. Because the LR model has an important epidemiologic interpretation, the SL method was modified to produce the analogous interpretation and generate odds ratios for comparison. The SL approach is capable of generating odds ratios for main effects and risk factor interactions that better capture nonlinear relationships between exposure variables and outcome in comparison with LR. Conclusions: The integration of SL methods in epidemiology may improve both the understanding and interpretation of complex exposure\/disease relationships.","meta":{"paper_id":"5303b7430b20a5e665f7cadd07ae77baa5687e73","title":"Statistical learning techniques applied to epidemiology: a simulated case-control comparison study with logistic regression"}}

{"text":"The effect of newly emerging or re-emerging infectious diseases of zoonotic origin in human populations can be potentially catastrophic, and large-scale investigations of such diseases are highly challenging. The monitoring of emergence events is subject to ascertainment bias, whether at the level of species discovery, emerging disease events, or disease outbreaks in human populations. Disease surveillance is generally performed post hoc, driven by a response to recent events and by the availability of detection and identification technologies. Additionally, the inventory of pathogens that exist in mammalian and other reservoirs is incomplete, and identifying those with the potential to cause disease in humans is rarely possible in advance. A major step in understanding the burden and diversity of zoonotic infections, the local behavioral and demographic risks of infection, and the risk of emergence of these pathogens in human populations is to establish surveillance networks in populations that maintain regular contact with diverse animal populations, Maia A Rabaa, Ngo Tri Tue, and Tran My Phuc contributed equally to this work. \u00d3 2015 The Author (s) and to simultaneously characterize pathogen diversity in human and animal populations.

{"text":"Mixed viral and bacterial infections are widely described in community-acquired pneumonia; however, the clinical implications of co-infection on the associated immunopathology remain poorly studied. In this study, microRNA, mRNA and cytokine\/chemokine secretion profiling were investigated for human monocyte-derived macrophages infected in-vitro with Influenza virus A\/H1N1 and\/or Streptococcus pneumoniae. We observed that the in-vitro co-infection synergistically increased interferon-\u03b3induced protein-10 (CXCL10, IP-10) expression compared to the singly-infected cells conditions. We demonstrated that endogenous miRNA-200a-3p, whose expression was synergistically induced following co-infection, indirectly regulates CXCL10 expression by targeting suppressor of cytokine signaling-6 (SOCS-6), a well-known regulator of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, in a subsequent clinical pilot study, immunomodulators levels were evaluated in samples from 74 children (\u22645 years-old) hospitalized with viral and\/or bacterial community-acquired pneumonia. Clinically, among the 74 cases of pneumonia, patients with identified mixed-detection had significantly higher (3.6-fold) serum IP-10 levels than those with a single detection (P = 0.03), and were significantly associated with severe pneumonia (P < 0.01). This study demonstrates that viral and bacterial coinfection modulates the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and leads to exacerbated IP-10 expression, which could play a major role in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.

{"text":"Here, we found that HSV-2 does not allow induction of an autophagic response to infection, but maintains basal autophagy levels mostly unchanged during productive infection. Thus, we investigated the importance of basal autophagy for HSV-2 infection, using pharmacological autophagy suppression or cells genetically deficient in an autophagy-essential gene (ATG5). Interference with basal autophagy flux in cells significantly reduced viral replication and diminished the infection. These results indicate that basal autophagy plays an indispensable role required for a productive infection. Importantly, this study draws a sharp distinction between induced and basal autophagy, where the former acts as a viral clearance mechanism abrogating infection, while the latter supports infection. Human herpesvirus-2, also known as Herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), is a double-stranded DNA virus that affects over 16% of the global population aged 15-49 years, causing an immense epidemic 1,2 . HSV-2 primarily causes severe genital diseases associated with physical disorders (e.g. genital ulcers and inflammation) and psychosocial problems 3,4 . HSV-2 genital disease represents a top-alert condition due to the fact that the virus may be transmitted from mothers to neonates causing a neonatal infection with high mortality rate 5,6 and the fact that HSV-2 infection is a serious risk factor for HIV infection, enhancing HIV acquisition rate by 3-4 fold 7,8 . Moreover, HSV-2 was also found to contribute to corneal infections and other ocular pathologies 9,10 , or may cause meningitis 3,4,11 . Autophagy is a cellular catabolic pathway which degrades various cytoplasmic constituents such as misfolded proteins and protein aggregates, intracellular organelles or microbial pathogens 12,13 . During autophagy, the cargo to be degraded is recruited through autophagy receptors to the autophagic vesicles (autophagosomes) which eventually fuse with lysosomes, releasing their cargo that is then lysosomally degraded 12-14 . During conditions of nutrient deficiency, autophagy is induced to maintain energy pools in the cell, and prevent translational arrests, cell cycle delays or cell death [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . At the basal levels, autophagy plays other important homeostatic functions such as clearance of protein aggregates, and damaged organelles 12-14 . Disruption of autophagy sometimes results in the failure to adapt to stress conditions or starvation and may cause death of the cell or organism under such conditions 15,19 . HSV-1 and HSV-2 are closely related herpesviruses that rely on ICP34.5 protein as a major neurovirulence and neurotropism factor 20,21 . HSV-1 virus was shown to establish virulence via preventing launch of an autophagic response to infection, as HSV-1 ICP34.5 binds to and inhibits the autophagy mediator beclin1 22-25 . HSV-2 ICP34.5 shares some common features with HSV-1 ICP34.5 and also shows differences 26-28 . For example, HSV-2 ICP34.5 gene, contrary to HSV-1 ICP34.5, contains an intron and undergoes alternative splicing, yielding various structurally unique splice-variants 27 and protein products 28 . However, whether HSV-2 ICP34.5 inhibits autophagy responses in cells, similarly to HSV-1 ICP34.5, remains to be established. Very little is known about the role of autophagy in HSV-2 infection. Therefore, we investigated the role of autophagy in regulating HSV-2 infection. Our results demonstrate that basal autophagy, which is maintained at stable levels during productive HSV-2 infection, is required for successful HSV-2 infection, as its disruption prevented infection to a great extent.","meta":{"paper_id":"d31b2db65b2e8d40eee096d5e67185099c10c4d2","title":"Basal Autophagy Is Required for Herpes simplex Virus-2 Infection OPEN"}}

Clinical signs of PEDV infection (vomiting and diarrhea) and viral shedding were observed in both the Positive control and Treatment group' post-consumption with virus and microscopic lesions detected in intestinal samples No evidence of infection was observed in the Negative controls. Conclusions: These data provide proof of concept that contaminated complete feed can serve as a vehicle for PEDV infection of na\u00efve pigs using natural feeding behavior.","meta":{"paper_id":"449a30a14d55d5eb735468fac84e2dca5bcf75e4","title":"An evaluation of contaminated complete feed as a vehicle for porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection of na\u00efve pigs following consumption via natural feeding behavior: proof of concept"}}

Respiratory chronic diseases were associated with cough, Influenza-like illness (ILI) and the acquisition of H. influenzae. in the acquisition of S. pneumoniae and prevalence of ILI (aRR = 0.53, 95%CI [0.39-0.73] and aRR = 0.69, 95%CI [0.52-0.92] respectively). Individuals carrying rhinovirus and H. influenzae-S. pneumoniae together were respectively twice and five times more likely to have respiratory symptoms. Individual with H. influenzae-K. pneumoniae carriage were twice (p = 0.04) as likely to develop a cough. The use of disposable handkerchiefs was associated with a decrease in the acquisition of S. aureus (aRR = 0.75, 95%CI [0.57-0.97]). Results could be used to identify pilgrims at increased risk of RTIs and acquisition of respiratory pathogens. Results also confirm the effectiveness of influenza and IPD vaccinations in reducing ILI symptoms and acquisition of S. pneumoniae carriage respectively. The Hajj is one of the largest annual religious mass gatherings in the world. Each year, Saudi Arabia attracts over 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries, including about 2,000 from Marseille, France 1 . The Hajj presents major challenges in public health and infection control as the crowding conditions favor the acquisition, dissemination and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms 2 . Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are particularly frequent during the pilgrimage and are responsible for most causes of hospitalization, with community-acquired pneumonia being a major cause of serious illness among pilgrims 3 . Many studies have been conducted among Hajj pilgrims over the last decade, demonstrating the high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the frequent acquisition of respiratory pathogens 3-7 . The viruses most commonly acquired after the Hajj are human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) and influenza A virus (IAV). The most frequently acquired respiratory bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) 3 . However, the etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is likely multifactorial and complex. The potential effects of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus 8,9 , of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures including face-mask use and hand hygiene practice 10-12 have been investigated, mostly based on clinical criteria, but results of studies are contradictory. So far, to our knowledge, risk factors for pathogen acquisition during the Hajj are not clearly identified. Relationship between respiratory symptoms and carriage of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj also remain poorly understood making it difficult distinguishing between infection and colonization. We conducted this www.nature.com\/scientificreports www.nature.com\/scientificreports\/ study to identify risk factors for respiratory symptoms and respiratory pathogens carriage at the Hajj, including socio-demographics, vaccination against influenza and invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) and adherence to non-pharmaceutical preventive measures using data collected from 2014 to 2017. We also evaluated the relationship between pathogen carriage, including multiple carriage and respiratory symptoms. Characteristics of study participants. The study enrolled 485 pilgrims, 96.5% of whom filled both the pre-and post-travel questionnaires. The study population had a median age of 61.5 years (interquartile = (52 -68 years), min = 21, max = 96 years) and a male:female ratio of 1:1.3 (Table 1 ). The majority (88.4%) of the pilgrims were from North Africa. 66.3% had an indication for vaccination against IPD according to the French recommendation at the time of inclusion 13-20 . Diabetes (28.6%) and hypertension (29.5%) were the most common comorbidities (Table 1) . With regard to preventive measures, 96 (20.2%) pilgrims reported having been vaccinated against pneumococcal (PCV-13) in the last 5 years, representing 30.5% of pilgrims with an indication for IPD. 26.7% (127\/466) were vaccinated against influenza before their travel or in the past year. Two hundred sixty-one (56.0%) pilgrims reported using face masks during the Hajj. Also, 42.1% (196\/466), 50.4% (235\/466) and 73.6% (343\/466) pilgrims declared washing their hands during the Hajj more often than usual, using hand gel, and using disposable handkerchiefs during their stay in Saudi Arabia, respectively. Clinical features. Figure 1 shows the prevalence of respiratory symptoms among pilgrims during the Hajj. More than 80% of the pilgrims presented at least one respiratory symptoms, cough, sore throat and rhinitis being the most frequent. Influenza-like illness (ILI) was present in 16.9% of pilgrims. None suffered from pneumonia or other IPD, and only one was hospitalized during the 2017 Hajj season. Time between arrival in Saudi Arabia and onset of symptoms was 9.5 \u00b1 4.8 days (min = 0, max = 22 days).","meta":{"paper_id":"892e0a43f862ce5adb7611e7f5243e2a30724800","title":""}}
{"text":"Background: Multiple infections are common in natural host populations and interspecific parasite interactions are therefore likely within a host individual. As they may seriously impact the circulation of certain parasites and the emergence and management of infectious diseases, their study is essential. In the field, detecting parasite interactions is rendered difficult by the fact that a large number of co-infected individuals may also be observed when two parasites share common risk factors. To correct for these ''false interactions'', methods accounting for parasite risk factors must be used. In the present paper we propose such a method for presence-absence data (i.e., serology). Our method enables the calculation of the expected frequencies of single and double infected individuals under the independence hypothesis, before comparing them to the observed ones using the chi-square statistic. The method is termed ''the corrected chi-square.'' Its robustness was compared to a pre-existing method based on logistic regression and the corrected chi-square proved to be much more robust for small sample sizes. Since the logistic regression approach is easier to implement, we propose as a rule of thumb to use the latter when the ratio between the sample size and the number of parameters is above ten. Applied to serological data for four viruses infecting cats, the approach revealed pairwise interactions between the Feline Herpesvirus, Parvovirus and Calicivirus, whereas the infection by FIV, the feline equivalent of HIV, did not modify the risk of infection by any of these viruses. Conclusions\/Significance: This work therefore points out possible interactions that can be further investigated in experimental conditions and, by providing a user-friendly R program and a tutorial example, offers new opportunities for animal and human epidemiologists to detect interactions of interest in the field, a crucial step in the challenge of multiple infections.","meta":{"paper_id":"315303952d93ba93f55029cca73e2f483bc16362","title":"True versus False Parasite Interactions: A Robust Method to Take Risk Factors into Account and Its Application to Feline Viruses"}}
{"text":"Background: As of 31 st March 2010, more than 127,000 confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), including 800 deaths, were reported in mainland China. The distribution and characteristics of the confirmed cases in the initial phase of this pandemic in this country are largely unknown. The present study aimed to characterize the geographic distribution and patient characteristics of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic as well as to identify potential risk factors associated with adverse patient outcome in China, through retrospective analyses of 885 hospitalized cases with confirmed H1N1 infection. Methodology\/Principal Findings: The proportional hazards model was employed to detect risk factors for adverse outcome; the geo-statistical maps were used to characterize the distribution of all 2668 confirmed H1N1 patients throughout mainland China. The number of new cases increased slowly in May, 2009, but rapidly between June and August of the year. Confirmed cases were reported in 26 provinces; Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Fujian were the top five regions of the incidence of the virus infection. After being adjusted for gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease and other general symptoms, delay for more than two days before hospital admission (HR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5-0.7) and delayed onset of the H1N1-specific respiratory symptoms (HR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.2-0.4) were associated with adverse patient outcome. Conclusions\/Significance: The 2009 pandemic influenza A affected east and southeast coastal provinces and most populous cities more severely than other regions in mainland China due to higher risk of high level traffic-, high population density-, and high population mobility-associated H1N1 transmission.The clinical symptoms were mild in the initial phase of infection. Delayed hospital admission and delayed appearance of respiratory symptoms were among the major risk factors for poor patient outcome. These findings may have significant implications in the future pandemic preparedness and response.","meta":{"paper_id":"3ec7aa1d4381bbaa7f5fa69fa8eb7cc1d90a39f1","title":"Geographic Distribution and Risk Factors of the Initial Adult Hospitalized Cases of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in Mainland China"}}

In an effort to foster this interdisciplinary effort, we have also included a table that lists the definitions of key terms. The importance of understanding the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens in their reservoir hosts is emphasized as a tool to both assess risk factors for spillover and to test hypotheses related to treatment and\/or intervention strategies. In conclusion, we highlight the need for smart surveillance, viral discovery efforts and predictive modeling. A shift towards a predictive approach is necessary in today's globalized society because, as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, identification post-emergence is often too late to prevent global spread. Integrating molecular virology and ecological techniques will allow for earlier recognition of potentially dangerous pathogens, ideally before they jump from wildlife reservoirs into human or livestock populations and cause serious public health or conservation issues.

{"text":"Human cathepsin L belongs to the cathepsin family of proteolytic enzymes with primarily an endopeptidase activity. Although its primary functions were originally thought to be only of a housekeeping enzyme that degraded intracellular and endocytosed proteins in lysosome, numerous recent studies suggest that it plays many critical and specific roles in diverse cellular settings. Not surprisingly, the dysregulated function of cathepsin L has manifested itself in several human diseases, making it an attractive target for drug development. Unfortunately, several redundant and isoform-specific functions have recently emerged, adding complexities to the drug discovery process. To address this, a series of chemical biology tools have been developed that helped define cathepsin L biology with exquisite precision in specific cellular contexts. This review elaborates on the recently developed small molecule inhibitors and probes of human cathepsin L, outlining their mechanisms of action, and describing their potential utilities in dissecting unknown function. Molecules 2020, 25, 698 2 of 41 also now well established and has been a subject of elegant reviews elsewhere [25] [26] [27] . Unfortunately, several overlapping and redundant functions of cathepsin L have also emerged [5, [28] [29] [30] . It is therefore critically important that its functional biology in both normal and disease-specific cell types be clearly annotated before significant resources are directed in drug discovery endeavors. In this review, we will briefly outline the biogenesis of cathepsin L, describe its post-translational processing and trafficking, and highlight key structural features required for formation of an active and mature cathepsin L. A brief summary of cathepsin L biology and its role in human diseases is provided next. Finally, a detailed and up-to-date report on existing cathepsin L-targeting small molecule inhibitors and functional probes with their mechanistic details is described. Human cathepsin L gene, CTHL (Uniprot primary accession number: P07711), located at the 9q21-q22 position of chromosome 9, encodes for a total of 333 amino acid peptide sequence (M.W. = 37,564 kDa) [31] . The coding space includes the regions of a N-terminal signal peptide, two pro-peptides, and two mature peptides comprising of a heavy (H) chain and a light (L) chain ( Figure 1 ). After transcription, the signal peptide is co-translationally removed in polysome and the resulting 41 kDa pro-cathepsin L is translocated to endoplasmic reticulum where it undergoes N-linked glycosylation with mannose rich sugars. The mannose sugars on the pro-cathepsin L are then phosphorylated in cis Golgi by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase enzyme [32] . The mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors located on the surface of the trans Golgi network recognize the M6P-pro-cathepsin peptide and deliver the pro-cathepsin L peptide to the lysosome via the endolysosomal pathway. The weakly acidic environment of endosome\/lysosome releases M6P receptors and the phosphate group from mannose sugars is removed by a lysosomal acid phosphatase [33, 34] . Activation to mature cathepsin L form then occurs by removal of propeptides either by autocatalysis [35] or by aspartyl cathepsin D in the acidic environment of lysosome [36] . This leads to the double chain form of mature and active cathepsin L, comprising of H and L domains, connected by disulfide bridges, (Figure 2 ). It is to be noted here that several isoforms of cathepsin L have also been observed in specific cell types due to alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts and alternative translation [4, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .

At specific cellular locations, they seem to play pivotal roles in a wide range of functional activities. In addition to the degradation of cellular proteins by the endolysosomal pathway, cathepsin L also participates in the autophagic degradation pathway; it specifically degrades two autophagosomal markers, LC3-II and GABARAP-II [57] . The specialized podocyte cells in the kidney play a critical role in the retention of various proteins required to be maintained in blood plasma [58] . It was shown that the cytoplasmic variant of active cathepsin L can degrade two key proteins, GTPase dynamin and synaptopodin, required for podocyte's proper glomerular filtration function [23, 59, 60] . Consistently, a higher podocyte cathepsin L expression was found in a variety of proteinuric kidney diseases, and its functional inhibition (e.g., by creating cathepsin L resistant dynamin) led to reversing of the symptoms [23, 61] . Interestingly, a nuclear isoform of cathepsin L is associated with another unique function in kidney cells; it is involved in the proteolytic processing of Cux1, a cell cycle regulatory transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) [62, 63] . Indeed, in mouse model of PKD, a lower level of nuclear cathepsin L was corelated with an increased level of Cux1 protein in cysts [62] . Another type of cells where cathepsin L seems to play a major role in maintaining homeostasis is cardiomyocytes [17, [64] [65] [66] [67] . Early investigation by Stypmann et al. on a year old Ctsl\u2212\/\u2212 mice showed that they developed many key traits of dilated cardiomyopathy, such as interstitial myocardial fibrosis, cardiac chamber dilation, and impaired contraction. In addition, the newborn Ctsl\u2212\/\u2212 mice acquired increased number of acidic organelles, although with altered morphology and function. These studies indicate that the inhibition of cathepsin L activity in these cells is detrimental to the proper functioning of cardiac cells. This was further corroborated by an overexpression study of cathepsin L in mice cardiomyocytes that exhibited cardioprotective effect by inhibiting the Akt signaling pathway [68] . The function of secreted extracellular cathepsin L in cardiac remodeling and repair has also been studied extensively since it is known that many proteins of extracellular matrix (ECM) are also the physiological substrate of cathepsin L; these include laminin, collagen type I, IV and XVIII,. Ischemic heart disease is major risk factor for diabetic patients, unable to maintain their sugar levels efficiently. During cardiac repair, endothelial progenitor cells containing elevated levels of cathepsin L home on ischemic cells, and initiate the process of neovascularization [72] [73] [74] . In uncontrolled diabetic condition however, cathepsin L function in ECM space during neovascularization is significantly impaired; this hampers the ischemic repair process [15, 75] . Controlled release of trypsinogen from pancreatic acinar cells and its subsequent activation in duodenum is a critically important event and must be tightly regulated. Dysregulated release of activated trypsin results in an acute pancreatitis condition. While cathepsin B efficiently cleaves trypsinogen to produce enhanced levels of active trypsin promoting pancreatitis, cathepsin L acts a regulatory brake, and keeps the activation process under control. And it does so by cleaving trypsinogen at a distinct site, 3 amino acids C terminal to cathepsin B, thereby inactivating trypsinogen itself [76] . Consistently, Ctsl\u2212\/\u2212 mice showed increased trypsin activity in pancreas and surprisingly reduced pancreatitis due to diminished inflammation; this effect was attributed due to enhanced apoptosis of acinar cells (vs necrosis). In neuro-and immuno-biology, cathepsin L has important documented roles as well [77] [78] [79] [80] . For example, regulated secretory vesicles of the neuroendocrine system, such as chromaffin granules, house many mature function-ready enkephalin opioid peptides. Upon appropriate signaling stimuli, the activated enkephalin neuropeptides are secreted and released imparting their analgesic and immune-cell specific functions. Studies by Yasothornsrikul et al. revealed that cathepsin L is the proteolytic processing enzyme that renders active metenkephalin from proenkephalin [81] . In another studies, the severity of symptoms due to antigen-induced arthritis (AAI) was significantly reduced in Ctsl\u2212\/\u2212 mice due to a weakened T helper cell population in thymus [82] . Molecules 2020, 25, 698 5 of 41 The expression of cathepsin L is highly dysregulated in several human diseases, including diabetes, AAI, abdominal aortic aneurysm, liver fibrosis, and cancers [13, [82] [83] [84] [85] . Its involvement in numerous forms of highly invasive cancers is particularly noteworthy and is covered in great detail in recent reviews [25, 26, [86] [87] [88] . Early studies by Gottesman revealed that extracellular cathepsin L levels can increase up to 200-fold in transformed cells [89] . In the ECM environment, they can rapidly degrade several structural components and significantly increase the migratory\/invasive potential of these cells, promoting metastasis [86, 87] . Not surprisingly, cathepsin L inhibition by small molecule is considered a viable strategy for the development of novel anti-cancer agents.

A prospective study among children under two years of age, hospitalized with LRTI was conducted in two referral pediatric hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from May 2009 to December 2010. Socio-demographic, clinical data and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected on enrolment and discharge. Multiplex real-time RT-PCR (13 viruses) and quantitative RSV RT-PCR were used to identify viral pathogens, RSV load and subgroups. Among 632 cases, 48% were RSV positive. RSV infections occurred at younger age than three other leading viral infections i.e rhinovirus (RV), metapneumovirus (MPV), parainfluenza virus (PIV-3) and were significantly more frequent in the first 6 months of life. Clinical severity score of RSV infection was significantly higher than PIV-3 but not for RV or MPV. In multivariate analysis, RV infection was significantly associated with severity while RSV infection was not. Among RSV infections, neither viral load nor viral co-infections were significantly associated with severity.

{"text":"Background: Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in domestic and wild felids. Despite the clinical importance of feline retroviruses and the growing interest in cats as pets, information about FeLV and FIV in Malaysia is presently insufficient to properly advise veterinarians and pet owners. A cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2010 to December 2010 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with FeLV and FIV among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia. Plasma samples were harvested from the blood of 368 domestic cats and screened for evidence of FeLV p27 antigen and FIV antibodies, using an immunochromatographic kit. Additionally, data on cat demographics and health were collected using a structured questionnaire, and were evaluated as potential risk factors for FeLV or FIV status. Results: Of the 368 cats that were evaluated in this study, 12.2% (45\/368; 95% CI = 8.88 -15.58) were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 31.3%, (115\/368; 95% CI = 26.51 -35.99) were seropositive to FIV antibodies, and 4.3% (16\/368; 95% CI = 2.27 -6.43) had evidence of both viruses. Factors found to significantly increase the risk for FeLV seropositivity include sex, age, behaviour, sickness, and living in a multi-cat household. Seropositive response to FIV was significantly associated with sex, neuter status, age, behaviour, and health status. The present study indicates that FeLV and FIV are common among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia, and that factors related to cat demographics and health such as age, sex, behaviour, health status and type of household are important predictors for seropositive status to FeLV or FIV in peninsular Malaysia. High prevalence of FeLV or FIV observed in our study is of concern, in view of the immunosuppressive potentials of the two pathogens. Specific measures for control and prevention such as screening and routine vaccination are needed to ensure that FeLV and FIV are controlled in the cat population of peninsular Malaysia.","meta":{"paper_id":"f06dde80e1f11939bb7306853ca92a8c9382ede4","title":"Prevalence and risk factors of feline leukaemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus in peninsular Malaysia"}}
{"text":"TREM2 variants have been identified as risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs). Because TREM2 encodes a receptor exclusively expressed on immune cells, identification of these variants conclusively demonstrates that the immune response can play an active role in the pathogenesis of NDDs. These TREM2 variants also confer the highest risk for developing Alzheimer's disease of any risk factor identified in nearly two decades, suggesting that understanding more about TREM2 function could provide key insights into NDD pathology and provide avenues for novel immune-related NDD biomarkers and therapeutics. The expression, signaling and function of TREM2 in NDDs have been extensively investigated in an effort to understand the role of immune function in disease pathogenesis and progression. We provide a comprehensive review of our current understanding of TREM2 biology, including new insights into the regulation of TREM2 expression, and TREM2 signaling and function across NDDs. While many open questions remain, the current body of literature provides clarity on several issues. While it is still often cited that TREM2 expression is decreased by pro-inflammatory stimuli, it is now clear that this is true in vitro, but inflammatory stimuli in vivo almost universally increase TREM2 expression. Likewise, while TREM2 function is classically described as promoting an anti-inflammatory phenotype, more than half of published studies demonstrate a pro-inflammatory role for TREM2, suggesting that its role in inflammation is much more complex. Finally, these components of TREM2 biology are applied to a discussion of how TREM2 impacts NDD pathologies and the latest assessment of how these findings might be applied to immune-directed clinical biomarkers and therapeutics.","meta":{"paper_id":"ac51af9995edb441f0ce4fdc384908daa6e83675","title":"R E V I E W Open Access TREM2 in Neurodegenerative Diseases"}}

Diarrheic calves showed higher prevalence (33.3%) than non-diarrheic calves (4.62%) with strong statistical association (P < 0.05). The present study showed a high prevalence of septicemic E. coli in the farm and intervention is strongly recommended.","meta":{"paper_id":"ec0a66b8b227c1a0ced88608d544e3b98120d557","title":"Bacteriological study of calf colisepticemia in Alage Dairy Farm, Southern Ethiopia"}}
{"text":"The spread of pathogens in swine populations is in part determined by movements of animals between farms. However, understanding additional characteristics that predict disease outbreaks and uncovering landscape factors related to between-farm spread are crucial steps toward risk mitigation. This study integrates animal movements with environmental risk factors to identify the occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks. Using weekly farm-level incidence data from 332 sow farms, we applied machine-learning algorithms to quantify associations between risk factors and PEDV outbreaks with the ultimate goal of training predictive models and to identify the most important factors associated with PEDV occurrence. Our best algorithm was able to correctly predict whether an outbreak occurred during one-week periods with >80% accuracy. The most important predictors included pig movements into neighboring farms. Other important neighborhood attributes included hog density, environmental and weather factors such as vegetation, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation, and topographical features such as slope. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to simultaneously capture disease risks associated with long-distance animal movement as well as local spatial dynamics. The model presented here forms the foundation for near real-time disease mapping and will advance disease surveillance and control for endemic swine pathogens in the United States. The circulation of endemic and epidemic viruses in livestock populations at farm, regional, and national levels has significant impact on animal welfare and livestock production within the United States and globally 1 . Numerous mechanisms play an apparent role in the spread of viruses between farms, including the movement of infectious animals, airborne spread of aerosols, wildlife, and contaminated fomites (i.e., trucks, equipment, boots), feed and personnel 2-5 . However, the relative importance of those drivers for between-farm transmission remains poorly understood. Movement of animals into a farm, for example, clearly increases the probability of disease introduction 6 , and understanding the network of livestock movements and analyzing the routes, volumes, frequency, and risks associated with animal movement is a prerequisite effective preventive, control, and disease surveillance measures in livestock 6-8 . At the same time, local spread of viruses between neighboring farms in close spatial proximity has been repeatedly demonstrated, perhaps mediated by windborne or fomite-related mechanisms 9,10 . A farm's risk of infection may thus be impacted not just by its own animal movements, but also by movements made by neighbors. These local spatial dynamics are rarely accounted for in network-based assessments of risks associated with livestock movement, although such dynamics are an emergent property of epidemiological models simulating disease spread in spatial networks 11, 12 . Much of our understanding of between-farm pathogen transmission in the United States swine industry is based on outbreak investigations, case-control studies, cohorts and case reports involving a relatively small number of farms [13] [14] [15] . Large-scale datasets in which to investigate the interacting roles of animal movements versus local transmission in between-farm spread are largely lacking. This is especially true for endemic diseases, where farm-level occurrences are often not tracked, and for countries in which no regional or national-level databases 1 Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com\/scientificreports\/","meta":{"paper_id":"47654cf27ea49e075f800ff503bbeecb4168e224","title":"Identifying outbreaks of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus through animal movements and spatial neighborhoods OPEN"}}
{"text":"Infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a leading risk factor for chronic liver disease progression, including steatosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. With approximately 3% of the human population infected worldwide, HCV infection remains a global public health challenge. The efficacy of current therapy is still limited in many patients infected with HCV, thus a greater understanding of pathogenesis in HCV infection is desperately needed. Emerging lines of evidence indicate that HCV triggers a wide range of cellular stress responses, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress\/unfolded protein response (UPR), and autophagy. Also, recent studies suggest that these HCV-induced cellular responses may contribute to chronic liver diseases by modulating cell proliferation, altering lipid metabolism, and potentiating oncogenic pathways. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HCV infection in the pathogenesis of chronic liver diseases still remains to be determined. Here, we review the known stress response activation in HCV infection in vitro and in vivo, and also explore the possible relationship of a variety of cellular responses with the pathogenicity of HCV-associated diseases. Comprehensive knowledge of HCV-mediated disease progression shall shed new insights into the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and the development of new intervention strategy.","meta":{"paper_id":"33bee45e93ec92d0813e39a07e158605af679215","title":"Hepatitis C Virus and Cellular Stress Response: Implications to Molecular Pathogenesis of Liver Diseases"}}
{"text":"The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of postoperative pneumonia (POP) within 1 year after cancer surgery in patients with the five most common cancers (gastric, colorectal, lung, breast cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma [HCC]) in South Korea. This was a multicenter and retrospective cohort study performed at five nationwide cancer centers. The number of cancer patients in each center was allocated by the proportion of cancer surgery. Adult patients were randomly selected according to the allocated number, among those who underwent cancer surgery from January to December 2014 within 6 months after diagnosis of cancer. One-year cumulative incidence of POP was estimated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. An univariable Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors for POP development. As a multivariable analysis, confounders were adjusted using multiple Cox's PH regression model. Among the total 2000 patients, the numbers of patients with gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and HCC were 497 (25%), 525 (26%), 277 (14%), 552 (28%), and 149 (7%), respectively. Overall, the 1-year cumulative incidence of POP was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.4-2.6). The 1-year cumulative incidences in each cancer were as follows: lung 8.0%, gastric 1.8%, colorectal 1.0%, HCC 0.7%, and breast 0.4%. In multivariable analysis, older age, higher Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) score, ulcer disease, history of pneumonia, and smoking were related with POP development. In conclusions, the 1-year cumulative incidence of POP in the five most common cancers was 2%. Older age, higher CCI scores, smoker, ulcer disease, and previous pneumonia history increased the risk of POP development in cancer patients.

Knowledge about the pathways and mechanisms of transmission from animals to humans is limited; as of yet, transmission risks have not been quantified. Moreover the divergent sanitary situations and exposures to animals among populations in the Arabian Peninsula, where human primary cases appear to dominate, vs. other regions in the Middle East and Africa, with no reported human clinical cases and where the virus has been detected only in dromedaries, represents huge scientific and health challenges. Here, we have used expert-opinion elicitation in order to obtain ideas on relative importance of MERS-CoV risk factors and estimates of transmission risks from various types of contact between humans and dromedaries. Fourteen experts with diverse and extensive experience in MERS-CoV relevant fields were enrolled and completed an online questionnaire that examined pathways based on several scenarios, e.g., camels-camels, camels-human, bats\/other species to camels\/ humans, and the role of diverse biological substances (milk, urine, etc.) and potential fomites. Experts believed that dromedary camels play the largest role in MERS-CoV infection of other dromedaries; however, they also indicated a significant influence of the season (i.e. calving or weaning periods) on transmission risk. All experts thought that MERS-CoV-infected dromedaries and asymptomatic humans play the most important role in infection of humans, with bats and other species presenting a possible, but yet undefined, risk. Direct and indirect contact of humans with dromedary camels were identified as the most risky types of contact, when compared to consumption of various camel products, with estimated \"most likely\" incidence risks of at least 22 and 13% for direct and indirect contact, respectively. The results of our study are consistent with available, yet very limited, published data regarding the potential pathways of transmission of MERS-CoV at the animal-human interface. These results identify key knowledge gaps and highlight the need for more comprehensive, yet focused research to be conducted to better understand transmission between dromedaries and humans.","meta":{"paper_id":"691856452de91727b7b9b7644f82b4bc5876f32f","title":"Article 88 1 Original research"}}
{"text":"Infectious disease treatments, both pharmaceutical and vaccine, face three universal challenges: the difficulty of targeting treatments to high-risk 'superspreader' populations who drive the great majority of disease spread, behavioral barriers in the host population (such as poor compliance and risk disinhibition), and the evolution of pathogen resistance. Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals -analogous to 'transmissible immunization' that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multiscale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV genetherapy trial, could stably lower HIV\/AIDS prevalence by ,30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV\/AIDS prevalence by ,2fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.","meta":{"paper_id":"c44a9d064faca56bd284971828e4db13e656365c","title":"Autonomous Targeting of Infectious Superspreaders Using Engineered Transmissible Therapies"}}
{"text":"Background: Tonsillitis, with associated tonsillar hypertrophy, is a common disease of childhood, yet it is rarely associated with sudden death due to airway obstruction. Lethal complications involving the inflamed tonsils include haemorrhage, retropharyngeal abscess and disseminated sepsis. Case presentation: We report on a case of sudden and unexpected death in an 8-year-old female who was diagnosed with and treated for tonsillitis. The child was diagnosed with acute tonsillitis 2 days prior to her collapse and was placed on a course of oral antibiotics. There were no signs of upper or lower airway obstruction. She was found to be unresponsive by her caregiver and gasping for air in her bed in the early hours of the second morning after the start of treatment. Autopsy showed massive and symmetrically enlarged palatine tonsils. The tonsils filled the pharynx almost completely. The epiglottis and laryngeal mucosa at the base of the epiglottis in the vicinity of the aryepiglottic membrane and the superior aspect of the larynx displayed red-purple discoloration, with mucosal swelling and edema. Histological examination of the palatine tonsils revealed prominent lymphoid hyperplasia, but no evidence of acute inflammation. Conclusion: Palatine tonsillar hypertrophy in infants is a common feature of both viral and bacterial tonsillitis and has been postulated as a possible risk factor for Sudden and Unexplained Death in Infancy (SUDI), based on the theory of mechanical impediment of breathing by narrowing of the upper airway. The rounded shape of the tonsils may facilitate some airflow past the enlarged structures and hence protect against asphyxial death when the enlarged tonsils fill the laryngo-pharynx. Epiglottal and proximal laryngeal edema may play a more significant role in asphyxial unexpected deaths in cases of tonsillitis with tonsillar hypertrophy than previously suspected. This focusses the importance of careful examination of the epiglottis and proximal laryngeal mucosa, as part of a thorough examination of the laryngo-pharynx in cases of sudden death associated with tonsillar hypertrophy.","meta":{"paper_id":"faac6cddc8f0126d5f93e948689eead41f54ad1f","title":"Tonsillar hypertrophy and prolapse in a child -is epiglottitis a predisposing factor for sudden unexpected death?"}}
{"text":"Background: The aim of this study was to detect the associations between bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1) status of a herd and respiratory disease (BRD) occurrence and reproductive performance in pregnant heifers and cows. The association between management-related factors and higher BRD occurrence was also estimated. Methods: Serum samples, collected from cows and youngstock from 103 dairy cattle herds, were analyzed for antibodies against BHV-1, bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV), and Mycoplasma bovis. A questionnaire was used to collect data concerning herd management factors and reproductive performance, as well as the occurrence of clinical signs of respiratory disease in the last two years, as evaluated by the veterinarian or farm manager. Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and logistic regression analysis were performed to identify and quantify the risk factors. Results: A low to moderate prevalence (1-49%) of BRSV antibodies among youngstock was associated with a high occurrence of respiratory disease (OR = 6.2, p = 0.010) in cows and in-calf heifers. Employees of the farm may participate in the spread of such disease. Larger herd size, loose-housing of cows, housing youngstock separately from cows until pregnancy, and purchasing new animals were factors possibly related to a high occurrence of respiratory disease symptoms in pregnant heifers and cows. The highest risk of abortions (> 1.3%) and increased insemination index (number of inseminations per pregnancy) (> 1.9) occurred in herds with a moderate prevalence of BHV-1 antibodies (1-49%) in cows.

PLoS ONE 14(3): e0213501. https:\/\/doi.Viral bronchiolitis is frequent and has an important impact on the children's health care due to the high rates of hospitalization and mortality, especially of young infants [1, 2] . Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is the predominant etiological agent, but infections by other respiratory viruses, such as human rhinovirus (HRV), metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, influenza, adenovirus, and coronavirus, also occur. These infections with different respiratory virus present similar clinical characteristics, so etiological diagnosis can be carried out in clinical practice only by virus identification, either by molecular tests, immunofluorescence or culture methods [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Although the current guidelines do not indicate routine tests to identify the etiologic agent in infants with bronchiolitis, the etiological diagnosis may contribute to the prevention of nosocomial acquisition, since the transmission mechanisms diverge among respiratory viruses. Knowledge on molecular epidemiology also contributes to programming and organizing prophylactic strategies, such as the use of monoclonal antibodies to HRSV and influenza vaccination [3, 6] . Etiological diagnosis may also contribute for developing specific therapeutic approaches for each agent. Clinical and epidemiological evidences indicated that pathogenic pathways are different in HRSV and HRV infections [7] . HRSV is the main agent of bronchiolitis, responsible for high rates of hospitalization and it is a major cause of mortality, especially in premature infants and those with risk factors. Despite this fact, the therapeutic approach consists mainly in supportive measures [3] . HRV is the most common agent of cold and triggering asthma attacks in atopic individuals, however around 35% of asymptomatic subjects have positive results for HRV tests [8] . Serious infections by both agents in early life are associated with recurrent wheezing in the following years, but this association is stronger with HRV. While HRSV infection leads to structural and functional changes in the airways, HRV infections do not cause as many changes and are more related to atopy and asthma [9] . Clinical studies suggest that the use of corticosteroids during the acute phase of infection with high levels of HRV may reduce the risk of recurrent wheezing in the subsequent year [10, 11] . Differential patient responses to respiratory viruses lead to different clinical outcomes and, interestingly, it has been found that infections with different respiratory viruses (HRSV, HRV, Influenza A), as well as with different genotypes of the same virus (HRSV), present distinctive PBMC transcriptome signatures [12] [13] . Furthermore, PBMC transcriptome profiles can be used to assess disease severity in infants with HRSV [7] and to predict individualized responses to HRV [14] . Thus, besides contributing to clarify the etiology, genomic methods can bring important information on the pathogenic role of the different respiratory virus as single agents, or in codetection, and in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, which is especially important in HRV infections. In this study, we conducted a comparative global gene expression analysis of PBMC obtained from patients with acute viral bronchiolitis infected by HRSV (HRSV group) or by HRV (HRV group). We employed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) which allows the identification of transcriptional modules and their correlation with HRSV or HRV groups. This approach permitted the identification of distinct transcription modules for the HRSV and HRV groups. Moreover, differentially expressed genes in the PBMC expression profiles presented significant high fold-changes between HRSV and HRV groups and could be potential etiological markers.

Morbidity and mortality can be considerable on a farm with huge economic consequences for the farmer as well as compromised welfare for the mink kits. Although efforts have been taken to identify etiologic agents involved in outbreaks, the syndrome is still regarded as multifactorial and recurring problems on the same farms draw attention to management and environmental risk factors.

Data concerning management, biosecurity, hygiene, feed consumption, antibacterial prescription and production efficiency were analyzed. The proportion of 1-year old females, farm size (total number of females), energy supply per female in the late gestation period, and dogs accessing the farm area were significantly associated with being a case farm. Case farms were prescribed almost twice the amount of antibacterials per gestational unit (female and litter) as in control farms. Farmers on case farms spent significantly more time nursing and treating the animals and experienced more females with mastitis compared to farmers on control farms.

The data available to estimate the overall CFR are often gathered for other purposes (e.g., surveillance) in challenging circumstances. We describe two forms of bias that may affect the estimation of the overall CFR-preferential ascertainment of severe cases and bias from reporting delays-and review solutions that have been proposed and implemented in past epidemics. Also of interest is the estimation of the causal impact of specific interventions (e.g., hospitalization, or hospitalization at a particular hospital) on survival, which can be estimated as a relative CFR for two or more groups. When observational data are used for this purpose, three more sources of bias may arise: confounding, survivorship bias, and selection due to preferential inclusion in surveillance datasets of those who are hospitalized and\/or die. We illustrate these biases and caution against causal interpretation of differential CFR among those receiving different interventions in observational datasets. Again, we discuss ways to reduce these biases, particularly by estimating outcomes in smaller but more systematically defined cohorts ascertained before the onset of symptoms, such as those identified by forward contact tracing. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which these biases may affect non-causal interpretation of risk factors for death among cases.

{"text":"Background: Initial reports in May 2009 of the novel influenza strain H1N1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease.

Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniaepositive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p,0.0001). Conclusions\/Significance: The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

{"text":"Latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) oncogenic protein that has no intrinsic enzymatic activity or sequence homology to cellular or viral proteins. The oncogenic potential of LMP1 has been ascribed to pleiotropic signaling properties initiated through protein-protein interactions in cytosolic membrane compartments, but the effects of LMP1 extend to nuclear and extracellular processes. Although LMP1 is one of the latent genes required for EBV-immortalization of B cells, the biology of LMP1 in the pathogenesis of the epithelial cancer nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is more complex. NPC is prevalent in specific regions of the world with high incidence in southeast China. The epidemiology and time interval from seroconversion to NPC onset in adults would suggest the involvement of multiple risk factors that complement the establishment of a latent and persistent EBV infection. The contribution of LMP1 to EBV pathogenesis in polarized epithelia has only recently begun to be elucidated. Furthermore, the LMP1 gene has emerged as one of the most divergent sequences in the EBV genome. This review will discuss the significance of recent advances in NPC research from elucidating LMP1 function in epithelial cells and lessons that could be learned from mining LMP1 sequence diversity.","meta":{"paper_id":"d9d1928e12dca038ff13cd0188d9fdc10a0f560d","title":"cancers New Insights from Elucidating the Role of LMP1 in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma"}}
{"text":"Bats have been proposed as major reservoirs for diverse emerging infectious viral diseases, with rabies being the best known in Europe. However, studies exploring the ecological interaction between lyssaviruses and their natural hosts are scarce. This study completes our active surveillance work on Spanish bat colonies that began in 1992. Herein, we analyzed ecological factors that might affect the infection dynamics observed in those colonies. Between 2001 and 2011, we collected and tested 2,393 blood samples and 45 dead bats from 25 localities and 20 bat species. The results for dead confirmed the presence of EBLV-1 RNA in six species analyzed (for the first time in Myotis capaccinii). Samples positive for European bat lyssavirus-1 (EBLV-1)-neutralizing antibodies were detected in 68% of the localities sampled and in 13 bat species, seven of which were found for the first time (even in Myotis daubentonii, a species to date always linked to EBLV-2). EBLV-1 seroprevalence (20.7%) ranged between 11.1 and 40.2% among bat species and seasonal variation was observed, with significantly higher antibody prevalence in summer (July). EBLV-1 seroprevalence was significantly associated with colony size and species richness. Higher seroprevalence percentages were found in large multispecific colonies, suggesting that intra-and interspecific contacts are major risk factors for EBLV-1 transmission in bat colonies. Although bat-roosting behavior strongly determines EBLV-1 variability, we also found some evidence that bat phylogeny might be involved in batspecies seroprevalence. The results of this study highlight the importance of life history and roost ecology in understanding EBLV-1-prevalence patterns in bat colonies and also provide useful information for public health officials.","meta":{"paper_id":"b58b4809e706401c8f5851d5b0d2be93b8f431cf","title":"Ecological Factors Associated with European Bat Lyssavirus Seroprevalence in Spanish Bats"}}
{"text":"Background: Enteric outbreaks associated with child care centres (CCC) have been well documented internationally and in Canada. The current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease, but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. The purpose of this study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them. Methods: Focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Five focus groups were held with 40 participants. An open ended style of interviewing was used. Data were analyzed using content analysis. Results: CCC staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness. Staff used indepth knowledge of the children, the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness. The decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials, particularly when faced with challenges related to time, money, staffing and parents. Conclusion: CCC staff relied on experience and judgment in coordination with public health information to assist decision-making in the management of enteric illness and outbreaks. Advice and guidance from public health officials to CCC staff needs to be consistent yet flexible so that it may be adapted in a variety of situations and meet regulatory and public health requirements.

{"text":"Background: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection is the major cause of bronchiolitis in infants and is a risk factor for the development of asthma. Allergic asthmatics are more susceptible to RSV infection and viral exacerbation. Since the effectiveness of corticosteroids in treating RSV infection has been controversial, we tested fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol (Sal) alone versus FP plus Sal (FPS) on RSV-induced airway inflammation. Mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA) and infected with RSV. Following infection they were treated with FP, Sal, or FPS intranasally and airway hyperreactivity (AHR), inflammation and RSV titers were examined. The group treated with FPS showed significantly lower AHR compared to the group treated with FP or Sal alone. The group treated with FP alone showed slightly decreased (nonsignificant) AHR compared to controls. Treatment with FPS resulted in significant decreases in the percentage of eosinophils and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and in lung pathology compared to FP or Sal. FP alone decreased eosinophils but not neutrophils or lymphocytes, while Sal alone decreased eosinophils and neutrophils but not lymphocytes. FPS treatment of mice infected with RSV in the absence of allergen sensitization resulted in a 50% decrease of RSV titer in the lung and a reduction in neutrophils compared to FP or Sal. Conclusion: Together, these results indicate that fluticasone in combination with salmeterol is a more effective treatment for decreasing airway hyperreactivity and inflammation than either of them alone in allergen-sensitized, RSV-infected mice.","meta":{"paper_id":"b1f86a8d26afcb49621b2b3aba8eaf1851b95315","title":"Virology Journal Combined fluticasone propionate and salmeterol reduces RSV infection more effectively than either of them alone in allergen-sensitized mice"}}

However, no reliable biomarkers are currently available for accurate early detection of ARDS in patients with predisposing conditions. Objectives: This study examined risk factors and biomarkers for ARDS development and mortality in two prospective cohort studies. Methods: We examined clinical risk factors for ARDS in a cohort of 178 patients in Beijing, China who were admitted to the ICU and were at high risk for ARDS. Identified biomarkers were then replicated in a second cohort of1,878 patients in Boston, USA. Results: Of 178 patients recruited from participating hospitals in Beijing, 75 developed ARDS. After multivariate adjustment, sepsis (odds ratio [OR]:5.58, 95% CI: 1.70-18.3), pulmonary injury (OR: 3.22; 95% CI: 1.60-6.47), and thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet count ,80610 3 \/mL, (OR: 2.67; 95% CI: 1.27-5.62)were significantly associated with increased risk of developing ARDS.

{"text":"Background: Gray wolves (Canis lupus) were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park (YNP) after a .70 year absence, and as part of recovery efforts, the population has been closely monitored. In 1999 and 2005, pup survival was significantly reduced, suggestive of disease outbreaks. Methodology\/Principal Findings: We analyzed sympatric wolf, coyote (Canis latrans), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) serologic data from YNP, spanning 1991-2007, to identify long-term patterns of pathogen exposure, identify associated risk factors, and examine evidence for disease-induced mortality among wolves for which there were survival data. We found high, constant exposure to canine parvovirus (wolf seroprevalence: 100%; coyote: 94%), canine adenovirus-1 (wolf pups [0.5-0.9 yr]: 91%, adults [$1 yr]: 96%; coyote juveniles [0.5-1.5 yrs]: 18%, adults [$1.6 yrs]: 83%), and canine herpesvirus (wolf: 87%; coyote juveniles: 23%, young adults [1.6-4.9 yrs]: 51%, old adults [$5 yrs]: 87%) suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within YNP wolves and coyotes. An average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, although individuals' odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable. Wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV) was temporally variable, with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005, and perhaps a smaller, isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of YNP in 2002. The years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence, suggesting that CDV contributed to the observed mortality. Conclusions\/Significance: Of the pathogens we examined, none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in YNP. However, CDV appears capable of causing short-term population declines. Additional information on how and where CDV is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected might be useful for future management of the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population.","meta":{"paper_id":"335b0a3f21f764adcbe20ff71e422d823c410098","title":"A Serological Survey of Infectious Disease in Yellowstone National Park's Canid Community"}}

{"text":"on behalf of the members of the MERS-CoV outbreak investigation team of The Netherlands Abstract Background: In May 2014, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection, with closely related viral genomes, was diagnosed in two Dutch residents, returning from a pilgrimage to Medina and Mecca, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). These patients travelled with a group of 29 other Dutch travellers. We conducted an epidemiological assessment of the travel group to identify likely source(s) of infection and presence of potential risk factors. Methods: All travellers, including the two cases, completed a questionnaire focussing on potential human, animal and food exposures to MERS-CoV. The questionnaire was modified from the WHO MERS-CoV questionnaire, taking into account the specific route and activities of the travel group. Results: Twelve non-cases drank unpasteurized camel milk and had contact with camels. Most travellers, including one of the two patients (Case 1), visited local markets, where six of them consumed fruits. Two travellers, including Case 1, were exposed to coughing patients when visiting a hospital in Medina. Four travellers, including Case 1, visited two hospitals in Mecca. All travellers had been in contact with Case 1 while he was sick, with initially non-respiratory complaints. The cases were found to be older than the other travellers and both had co-morbidities. Conclusions: This epidemiological study revealed the complexity of MERS-CoV outbreak investigations with multiple potential exposures to MERS-CoV reported such as healthcare visits, camel exposure, and exposure to untreated food products. Exposure to MERS-CoV during a hospital visit is considered a likely source of infection for Case 1 but not for Case 2. For Case 2, the most likely source could not be determined. Exposure to MERS-CoV via direct contact with animals or dairy products seems unlikely for the two Dutch cases. Furthermore, exposure to a common but still unidentified source cannot be ruled out. More comprehensive research into sources of infection in the Arabian Peninsula is needed to strengthen and specify the prevention of MERS-CoV infections.","meta":{"paper_id":"0c0e91904a6c84a7ee80cc69fe83370aaa3ca708","title":"Travel-related MERS-CoV cases: an assessment of exposures and risk factors in a group of Dutch travellers returning from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, May 2014"}}
{"text":"Background: Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis is a chronic structural lung condition that courses with recurrent infectious exacerbations that lead to frequent antibiotic treatment making this population more susceptible to acquire pathogens with antibiotic resistance. We aimed to investigate risk factors associated with isolation of multidrug-resistant pathogens in bronchiectasis exacerbations. Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in two tertiary-care hospitals, enrolling patients when first exacerbation appeared. Multidrug-resistance was determined according to European Centre of Diseases Prevention and Control classification. Results: Two hundred thirty three exacerbations were included and microorganisms were isolated in 159 episodes. Multidrug-resistant pathogens were found in 20.1% episodes: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (48.5%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%) and Extended spectrum betalactamase + Enterobacteriaceae (6.1%), and they were more frequent in exacerbations requiring hospitalization (24.5% vs. 10.2%, p: 0.016). Three independent multidrugresistant risk factors were found: chronic renal disease (Odds ratio (OR), 7.60, 95% CI 1.92-30.09), hospitalization in the previous year (OR, 3.88 95% CI 1.37-11.02) and prior multidrug-resistant isolation (OR, 5.58, 95% CI 2.02-15.46). The proportion of multidrug-resistant in the 233 exacerbations was as follows: 3.9% in patients without risk factors, 12.6% in those with 1 factor and 53.6% if \u22652 risk factors. Conclusions: Hospitalization in the previous year, chronic renal disease, and prior multidrug-resistant isolation are risk factors for identification multidrug-resistant pathogens in exacerbations.

{"text":"Presence of ducks, and in particular of free-grazing ducks, has consistently been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks which has compromised poultry production in South-East Asia since the early 2000s and continues to threaten public health, farmers' livelihood and food security. Although freegrazing duck production has been practised for decades in South-East Asia, there are few published studies describing this production system, which is suspected to play an important role in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses. This study aimed at describing quantitatively the long-distance free-grazing duck production system in South Vietnam, characterising the movement and contact patterns of the duck flocks, and identifying potential associations between farming practices, movement and contact patterns and the circulation of avian influenza viruses. We conducted interviews among stakeholders involved in the free-grazing duck production system (duck farmers, transporters and rice paddy owners) in combination with a virological cross-sectional survey in South Vietnam. Results show that both direct and indirect contacts between free-grazing duck flocks were frequent and diverse. The flocks were transported extensively across district and province boundaries, mainly by boat but also by truck or on foot. A third of the investigated flocks had a positive influenza A virology test, indicating current circulation of avian influenza viruses, but none were positive for H5 subtypes. The age and size of the flock as well as its location at the time of sampling were associated with the risk of influenza A circulation in the flocks. These findings should be considered when developing risk assessment models of influenza virus spread aimed at informing the development of improved biosecurity practices leading to enhanced animal health, sustainable animal production and reliable income for farmers.","meta":{"paper_id":"589fe7dd846e7bbab5e7d6dacf7fab2ca6c4f340","title":"Movement and contact patterns of long- distance free-grazing ducks and avian influenza persistence in Vietnam"}}

{"text":"Background: Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) remains among the leading causes of death of cattle internationally. The objective of this study was to identify risk factors associated with exposure to BRD pathogens during the peri-weaning period (day (d)-14 to d 14 relative to weaning at 0) in dairy bull calves using serological responses to these pathogens as surrogate markers of exposure. Clinically normal Holstein-Friesian and Jersey breed bull calves (n = 72) were group housed in 4 pens using a factorial design with calves of different breeds and planes of nutrition in each pen. Intrinsic, management and clinical data were collected during the pre-weaning (d \u2212 56 to d \u2212 14) period. Calves were gradually weaned over 14 days (d \u2212 14 to d 0). Serological analysis for antibodies against key BRD pathogens (BRSV, BPI3V, BHV-1, BHV-4, BCoV, BVDV and H. somni) was undertaken at d \u2212 14 and d 14. Linear regression models (for BVDV, BPI3V, BHV-1, BHV-4, BCoV and H. somni) and a single mixed effect random variable model (for BRSV) were used to identify risk factors for changes in antibody levels to these pathogens. Results: BRSV was the only pathogen which demonstrated clustering by pen. Jersey calves experienced significantly lower changes in BVDV S\/P than Holstein-Friesian calves. Animals with a high maximum respiratory score (\u22658) recorded significant increases in H. somni S\/P during the peri-weaning period when compared to those with respiratory scores of \u22643. Haptoglobin levels of between 1.32 and 1.60 mg\/ml at d \u2212 14 were significantly associated with decreases in BHV-1 S\/N during the peri-weaning period. Higher BVDV S\/P ratios at d \u2212 14 were significantly correlated with increased changes in serological responses to BHV-4 over the peri-weaning period. Conclusions: Haptoglobin may have potential as a predictor of exposure to BHV-1. BRSV would appear to play a more significant role at the 'group' rather than 'individual animal' level.

Carriage of the main respiratory pathogens was assessed by PCR. 121 pilgrims were included and 93.4% reported respiratory symptoms during the study period. The acquisition of rhinovirus, coronaviruses and Staphylococcus aureus occurred soon after arrival in Saudi Arabia and rates decreased gradually after days 5 and 6. In contrast, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae carriage increased progressively until the end of the stay in Saudi Arabia. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis carriage increased starting around days 12 and 13, following an initial clearance. Influenza viruses were rarely isolated. We observed an independent positive mutual association between S. aureus and rhinovirus carriage and between H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis carriage. Dual carriage of H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis was strongly associated with S. pneumoniae carriage (OR = 6.22). Finally, our model showed that M. catarrhalis carriage was negatively associated with K. pneumoniae carriage. Chronic respiratory disease was associated with symptoms of LRTI.

{"text":"Background: Both bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections are currently wide-spread in the Swedish dairy cattle population. Surveys of antibody levels in bulk tank milk have shown very high nationwide prevalences of both BCV and BRSV, with large variations between regions. In the Swedish beef cattle population however, no investigations have yet been performed regarding the prevalence and geographical distribution of BCV and BRSV. A cross-sectional serological survey for BCV and BRSV was carried out in Swedish beef cattle to explore any geographical patterns of these infections. Methods: Blood samples were collected from 2,763 animals located in 2,137 herds and analyzed for presence of antibodies to BCV and BRSV. Moran's I was calculated to assess spatial autocorrelation, and identification of geographical cluster was performed using spatial scan statistics. Results: Animals detected positive to BCV or BRSV were predominately located in the central-western and some southern parts of Sweden. Moran's I indicated global spatial autocorrelation. BCV and BRSV appeared to be spatially related: two areas in southern Sweden (Skaraborg and Sk\u00e5ne) had a significantly higher prevalence of BCV (72.5 and 65.5% respectively); almost the same two areas were identified as being high-prevalence clusters for BRSV (69.2 and 66.8% respectively). An area in south-east Sweden (Kronoberg-Blekinge) had lower prevalences for both infections than expected (23.8 and 20.7% for BCV and BRSV respectively). Another area in middle-west Sweden (V\u00e4rmland-Dalarna) had also a lower prevalence for BRSV (7.9%). Areas with beef herd density > 10 per 100 km 2 were found to be at significantly higher risk of being part of high-prevalence clusters.

Although the spatial distribution of H5N1 outbreaks and risk factors for virus occurrence has been extensively studied, there have been no comparative studies for H5N6. Data collected through active surveillance of Vietnamese live bird markets (LBMs) between 2011 and 2015 were used to explore and compare the spatiotemporal distributions of H5N1-and H5N6-positive LBMs. Conditional autoregressive models were developed to quantify spatiotemporal associations between agroecological factors and the two HPAI strains using the same set of predictor variables. Unlike H5N1, which exhibited a strong north-south divide, with repeated occurrence in the extreme south of a cluster of high-risk provinces, H5N6 was homogeneously distributed throughout Vietnam. Similarly, different agroecological factors were associated with each strain. Sample collection in the months of January and February and higher average maximum temperature were associated with higher likelihood of H5N1-positive market-day status. The likelihood of market days being positive for H5N6 increased with decreased river density, and with successive Rounds of data collection. This study highlights marked differences in spatial patterns and risk factors for H5N1 and H5N6 in Vietnam, suggesting the need for tailored surveillance and control approaches.","meta":{"paper_id":"24c4787033b7069da07ce6b0b8f85f6fd5ad84b2","title":"comparative epidemiology of highly Pathogenic avian influenza Virus h5n1 and h5n6 in Vietnamese live Bird Markets: spatiotemporal Patterns of Distribution and risk Factors"}}
{"text":"Background: Knowing the national disease burden of severe influenza in low-income countries can inform policy decisions around influenza treatment and prevention.

This base rate of SARI is then adjusted for each province based on the prevalence of risk factors and healthcare-seeking behavior. The percentage of SARI with influenza virus detected is determined from provincial-level sentinel surveillance and applied to the adjusted provincial rates of hospitalized SARI. Healthcare-seeking data from healthcare utilization surveys is used to estimate non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI.

{"text":"Feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) is a retrovirus associated with fatal disease in progressively infected cats. While testing\/removal and vaccination led to a decreased prevalence of FeLV, recently, this decrease has reportedly stagnated in some countries. This study aimed to prospectively determine the prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats taken to veterinary facilities in 32 European countries. FeLV viral RNA was semiquantitatively detected in saliva, using RT-qPCR as a measure of viraemia. Risk and protective factors were assessed using an online questionnaire to report geographic, demographic, husbandry, FeLV vaccination, and clinical data. The overall prevalence of FeLV viraemia in cats visiting a veterinary facility, of which 10.4% were shelter and rescue cats, was 2.3% (141\/6005; 95% CI: 2.0%-2.8%) with the highest prevalences in Portugal, Hungary, and Italy\/Malta (5.7%-8.8%). Using multivariate analysis, seven risk factors (Southern Europe, male intact, 1-6 years of age, indoor and outdoor or outdoor-only living, living in a group of \u22655 cats, illness), and three protective factors (Northern Europe, Western Europe, pedigree cats) were identified. Using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis, the origin of cats in Europe, pedigree, and access to outdoors were important predictors of FeLV status. FeLV-infected sick cats shed more viral RNA than FeLV-infected healthy cats, and they suffered more frequently from anaemia, anorexia, and gingivitis\/stomatitis than uninfected sick cats. Most cats had never been FeLV-vaccinated; vaccination rates were indirectly associated with the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

{"text":"Background: Hepatic steatosis is recognized as a major risk factor for liver disease progression and impaired response to interferon based therapy in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients. The mechanism of response to interferon-alpha (IFN-\u03b1) therapy under the condition of hepatic steatosis is unexplored. We investigated the effect of hepatocellular steatosis on hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication and IFN-\u03b1 antiviral response in a cell culture model. Methods: Sub-genomic replicon (S3-GFP) and HCV infected Huh-7.5 cells were cultured with a mixture of saturated (palmitate) and unsaturated (oleate) long-chain free fatty acids (FFA). Intracytoplasmic fat accumulation in these cells was visualized by Nile red staining and electron microscopy then quantified by microfluorometry. The effect of FFA treatment on HCV replication and IFN-\u03b1 antiviral response was measured by flow cytometric analysis, Renilla luciferase activity, and real-time RT-PCR. Results: FFA treatment induced dose dependent hepatocellular steatosis and lipid droplet accumulation in the HCV replicon cells was confirmed by Nile red staining, microfluorometry, and by electron microscopy. Intracellular fat accumulation supports replication more in the persistently HCV infected culture than in the sub-genomic replicon (S3-GFP) cell line. FFA treatment also partially blocked IFN-\u03b1 response and viral clearance by reducing the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 dependent IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation. We show that FFA treatment induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and down regulates the IFNAR1 chain of the type I IFN receptor leading to defective Jak-Stat signaling and impaired antiviral response. Conclusion: These results suggest that intracellular fat accumulation in HCV cell culture induces ER stress, defective Jak-Stat signaling, and attenuates the antiviral response, thus providing an explanation to the clinical observation regarding how hepatocellular steatosis influences IFN-\u03b1 response in CHC.","meta":{"paper_id":"54ebc03fe88092d143f0758472adf54252d6c224","title":"Free fatty acids induce ER stress and block antiviral activity of interferon alpha against hepatitis C virus in cell culture"}}
{"text":"Background: Bats receive increasing attention in infectious disease studies, because of their well recognized status as reservoir species for various infectious agents. This is even more important, as bats with their capability of long distance dispersal and complex social structures are unique in the way microbes could be spread by these mammalian species. Nevertheless, infection studies in bats are predominantly limited to the identification of specific pathogens presenting a potential health threat to humans. But the impact of infectious agents on the individual host and their importance on bat mortality is largely unknown and has been neglected in most studies published to date. Methodology\/Principal Findings: Between 2002 and 2009, 486 deceased bats of 19 European species (family Vespertilionidae) were collected in different geographic regions in Germany. Most animals represented individual cases that have been incidentally found close to roosting sites or near human habitation in urban and urban-like environments. The bat carcasses were subjected to a post-mortem examination and investigated histo-pathologically, bacteriologically and virologically. Trauma and disease represented the most important causes of death in these bats. Comparative analysis of pathological findings and microbiological results show that microbial agents indeed have an impact on bats succumbing to infectious diseases, with fatal bacterial, viral and parasitic infections found in at least 12% of the bats investigated. Conclusions\/Significance: Our data demonstrate the importance of diseases and infectious agents as cause of death in European bat species. The clear seasonal and individual variations in disease prevalence and infection rates indicate that maternity colonies are more susceptible to infectious agents, underlining the possible important role of host physiology, immunity and roosting behavior as risk factors for infection of bats.","meta":{"paper_id":"550494d6d01569a05a8ca2d75f892486b01d1865","title":"Diseases and Causes of Death in European Bats: Dynamics in Disease Susceptibility and Infection Rates"}}

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, University of York CRD databases, EuroScan, LILACS, Indian Medlars, Index Medicus for SE Asia, international health technology agencies and the Internet in all languages for articles from 01\/01\/1990 to 22\/10\/2010. Independent reviewers screened abstracts using pre-defined criteria, obtained full-text articles, selected relevant studies, and abstracted data. Disagreements were resolved by consensus. The outcome of interest was risk of ARI transmission. The quality of evidence was rated using the GRADE system. We identified 5 case-control and 5 retrospective cohort studies which evaluated transmission of SARS to HCWs. Procedures reported to present an increased risk of transmission included [n; pooled OR(95%CI)] tracheal intubation [n = 4 cohort; 6.6 (2.3, 18.9), and n = 4 case-control; 6.6 (4.1, 10.6)], non-invasive ventilation [n = 2 cohort; OR 3.1(1.4, 6.8)], tracheotomy [n = 1 case-control; 4.2 (1.5, 11.5)] and manual ventilation before intubation [n = 1 cohort; OR 2.8 (1.3, 6.4)].

A survey was conducted in order to assess the potential of Vietnamese and Cambodian live bird markets (LBMs) to sustain circulation of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 (HPAIV H5N1). Thirty Vietnamese and 8 Cambodian LBMs were visited, and structured interviews were conducted with the market managers and 561 Vietnamese and 84 Cambodian traders. Multivariate and cluster analysis were used to construct a typology of traders based on their poultry management practices. As a result of those practices and large poultry surplus (unsold poultry reoffered for sale the following day), some poultry traders were shown to promote conditions favorable for perpetuating HPAIV H5N1 in LBMs. More than 80% of these traders operated in LBMs located in the most densely populated areas, Ha Noi and Phnom Penh. The profiles of sellers operating at a given LBM could be reliably predicted using basic information about the location and type of market. Consequently, LBMs with the largest combination of risk factors for becoming virus reservoirs could be easily identified, potentially allowing control strategies to be appropriately targeted. These findings are of particular relevance to resource-scarce settings with extensively developed LBM systems, commonly found in South-East Asia.","meta":{"paper_id":"e81fa612268526f1a649e7d5e70c90dc9c1c4cca","title":"Identifying Live Bird Markets with the Potential to Act as Reservoirs of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus: A Survey in Northern Viet Nam and Cambodia"}}
{"text":"Background: The structure of contact between individuals plays an important role in the incursion and spread of contagious diseases in both human and animal populations. In the case of avian influenza, the movement of live birds is a well known risk factor for the geographic dissemination of the virus among poultry flocks. Live bird markets (LBM's) contribute to the epidemiology of avian influenza due to their demographic characteristics and the presence of HPAI H5N1 virus lineages. The relationship between poultry producers and live poultry traders (LPT's) that operate in LBM's has not been adequately documented in HPAI H5N1-affected SE Asian countries. The aims of this study were to document and study the flow of live poultry in a poultry trade network in northern Vietnam, and explore its potential role in the risk for HPAI H5N1 during 2003 to 2006. Our results indicate that LPT's trading for less than a year and operating at retail markets are more likely to source poultry from flocks located in communes with a past history of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks during 2003 to 2006 than LPT's trading longer than a year and operating at wholesale markets. The results of the network analysis indicate that LPT's tend to link communes of similar infection status. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence which can be used for informing policies aimed at encouraging more biosecure practices of LPT's operating at authorised LBM's. The results suggest that LPT's play a role in HPAI H5N1 transmission and may contribute to perpetuating HPAI H5N1 virus circulation amongst certain groups of communes. The impact of current disease prevention and control interventions could be enhanced by disseminating information about outbreak risk and the implementation of a formal data recording scheme at LBM's for all incoming and outgoing LPT's.","meta":{"paper_id":"345180770287ab9188e2dcfa2fd2ba0cd58214bb","title":"Associations between attributes of live poultry trade and HPAI H5N1 outbreaks: a descriptive and network analysis study in northern Vietnam"}}

Nasopharyngeal aspirates were tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction. We estimated hospital-attended influenza-positive SARI incidence rates and assessed factors associated with influenza positivity and clinical severity (Modified Early Warning Score > 4). We enrolled 1,126 SARI cases; 163 (14.5%) were positive for influenza. Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence was 50.3%.

A search for LAI and zoonoses in the Asia-Pacific region using online search engines revealed a relatively low number of reports. Only 27 LAI reports were published between 1982 and 2016. The most common pathogens associated with LAIs were dengue virus, Arthroderma spp., Brucella spp., Mycobacterium spp., Rickettsia spp., and Shigella spp. Seventy-eight percent (21 out of 27 LAI reports) occurred in high-income countries (i.e., Australia, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan) where laboratories were likely to comply with international biosafety standards. Two upper-middle income countries (China (2), and Malaysia (2)) and one lower-middle income country (India (2)) reported LAI incidents. The majority of the reports (fifty-two percent (14\/27)) of LAIs occurred in research laboratories. Five LAI reports were from clinical or diagnostic laboratories that are considered at the frontier for zoonotic disease detection. Governments and laboratories in the Asia-Pacific region should be encouraged to report LAI cases as it provides a useful tool to monitor unintended release of zoonotic pathogens and to further improve laboratory biosafety. Non-reporting of LAI events could pose a risk of disease transmission from infected laboratory staff to communities and the environment.

We asked local health departments in Germany to identiy notified Q fever patients who had visited the farmers market. To investigate risk factors for infection we conducted a case control study (cases were Q fever patients, controls were randomly selected Soest citizens) and a cohort study among vendors at the market. The sheep exhibited at the market, the herd from which it originated as well as sheep from herds held in the vicinity of Soest were tested for Coxiella burnetii (C. burnetii). Results: A total of 299 reported Q fever cases was linked to this outbreak. The mean incubation period was 21 days, with an interquartile range of 16-24 days. The case control study identified close proximity to and stopping for at least a few seconds at the sheep's pen as significant risk factors. Vendors within approximately 6 meters of the sheep's pen were at increased risk for disease compared to those located farther away. Wind played no significant role. The clinical attack rate of adults and children was estimated as 20% and 3%, respectively, 25% of cases were hospitalized. The ewe that had lambed as well as 25% of its herd tested positive for C. burnetii antibodies. Conclusion: Due to its size and point source nature this outbreak permitted assessment of fundamental, but seldom studied epidemiological parameters. As a consequence of this outbreak, it was recommended that pregnant sheep not be displayed in public during the 3 rd trimester and to test animals in petting zoos regularly for C. burnetii.","meta":{"paper_id":"ee1b5a9618dcc4080ed100486cedd0969e80fa4d","title":"BMC Infectious Diseases A super-spreading ewe infects hundreds with Q fever at a farmers' market in Germany"}}
{"text":"Background: Hepatitis A (HA) is a low-incidence, non-endemic disease in Canada and the United States (US). However, a large difference in HA incidence between Canada and HA-endemic countries has made travel an important contributor to hepatitis A prevalence in Canada. There is also a (smaller) incidence differential between Canada and the US. Although the US has only moderately higher HA incidence, the volume of travel by Canadians to the US is many times higher than travel volume to endemic countries. Hence, travel to the US may constitute a source of low to moderate risk for Canadian travelers. To our knowledge, travel to the US has never been included as a potential risk factor for HA infection in Canadian epidemiologic analyses. The objective of this study was to use dynamic models to investigate the possible effects on hepatitis A incidence in Canada due to (1) implementing vaccination in the US, and (2) varying the volume of travel by Canadians to the US. We developed and analyzed age-structured compartmental models for the transmission and vaccination of hepatitis A, for both Canada and the US. Models were parameterized using data on seroprevalence, case reporting, and travel patterns. The potential effect of hepatitis A prevalence in the US on hepatitis A prevalence in Canada was captured through a term representing infection of Canadians due to travel in the US. The model suggests that approximately 22% of HA cases in Canada in the mid 1990s may have been attributable to travel to the US. A universal vaccination programme that attained 70% coverage in young children in the US in the mid 1990s could have reduced Canadian incidence by 21% within 5 years. Since not all necessary data were available to parameterize the model, the results should be considered exploratory. However, the analysis shows that, under plausible assumptions, the US may be more important for determining HA prevalence in Canada than is currently supposed. As international travel continues to grow, making vaccination policies ever more relevant to populations beyond a country's borders, such multi-country models will most likely come into wider use as predictive aids for policy development.","meta":{"paper_id":"f40d65d9dcb0b71bd266e62f77bc51d4c449eed1","title":"BMC Infectious Diseases The United States and Canada as a coupled epidemiological system: An example from hepatitis A"}}

A multi-country matched case-control study was conducted in 2011 to identify calf-level risk factors for BNP. 405 BNP cases were recruited from 330 farms in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands by laboratory confirmation of farmer-reported cases. Up to four calves of similar age from the same farm were selected as controls (1154 calves). Risk factor data were collected by questionnaire. Multivariable modelling using conditional logistic regression indicated that PregSureHBVD (PregSure, Pfizer Animal Health) vaccination of the dam was strongly associated with BNP cases (adjusted matched Odds Ratio -amOR 17.8 first lactation dams; 95% confidence interval -ci 2.4, 134.4; p = 0.005), and second or more lactation PregSure-vaccinated dams were more likely to have a case than first lactation vaccinated dams (amOR 2.2 second lactation; ci 1.1, 4.3; p = 0.024; amOR 5.3 third or more lactation; ci 2.9, 9.8; p = ,0.001). Feeding colostrum from other cows was strongly associated with BNP if the dam was not PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 30.5; ci 2.1, 440.5; p = 0.012), but the effect was less if the dam was PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 2.1; ci 1.1, 4.0; p = 0.024). Feeding exclusively dam's milk was a higher risk than other types of milk (amOR 3.4; ci 1.6, 7.5; p = 0.002).

{"text":"Recent outbreaks of novel infectious diseases (e.g. SARS, influenza H1N1) have highlighted the threat of cross-species pathogen transmission. When first introduced to a population, a pathogen is often poorly adapted to its new host and must evolve in order to escape extinction. Theoretical arguments and empirical studies have suggested various factors to explain why some pathogens emerge and others do not, including host contact structure, pathogen adaptive pathways and mutation rates. Using a multi-type branching process, we model the spread of an introduced pathogen evolving through several strains. Extending previous models, we use a network-based approach to separate host contact patterns from pathogen transmissibility. We also allow for arbitrary adaptive pathways. These generalizations lead to novel predictions regarding the impact of hypothesized risk factors. Pathogen fitness depends on the host population in which it circulates, and the 'riskiest' contact distribution and adaptive pathway depend on initial transmissibility. Emergence probability is sensitive to mutation probabilities and number of adaptive steps required, with the possibility of large adaptive steps (e.g. simultaneous point mutations or recombination) having a dramatic effect.

Through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey, we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six Atlantic Forest fragments in southeast Brazil. Results: Widespread exposure to canine parvovirus (97 %), canine distemper virus (15 %) and canine adenovirus (27 %) was detected, but none for canine coronavirus. Dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks. Exposure was associated with dog sex and age, lack of health care and the number of people in the households. Remarkably, factors linked to free-ranging behaviour of dogs were associated with the exposure for all pathogens detected. Conclusions: According to identified associations, reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dog's movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance. Promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary. The study provides support for preventive management actions aimed to protect the health of rural dogs, and consequently of Atlantic Forest's wild carnivores.","meta":{"paper_id":"eb856c32c1a41e6513729e126e84e639ce4f5a68","title":"Prevalence and risk factors for viral exposure in rural dogs around protected areas of the Atlantic forest"}}
{"text":"Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection is associated with high mortality rates but limited clinical data have been reported. We describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data from all adult (>18 years old) patients admitted to our 20-bed mixed ICU with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection between October 1, 2012 and May 31, 2014. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples. Results: During the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 \u00b1 20 years, 22 [71 %] males). Cough and tachypnea were reported in all patients; 22 (77.4 %) patients had bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. Invasive mechanical ventilation was applied in 27 (87.1 %) and vasopressor therapy in 25 (80.6 %) patients during the intensive care unit stay. Twenty-three (74.2 %) patients died in the ICU. Nonsurvivors were older, had greater APACHE II and SOFA scores on admission, and were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation and vasopressor therapy. After adjustment for the severity of illness and the degree of organ dysfunction, the need for vasopressors was an independent risk factor for death in the ICU (odds ratio = 18.33, 95 % confidence interval: 1.11-302.1, P = 0.04). Conclusions: MERS-CoV infection requiring admission to the ICU is associated with high morbidity and mortality.

{"text":"Background: An outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), comprising 185 cases linked to healthcare facilities, occurred in the Republic of Korea from May to July 2015. Owing to the nosocomial nature of the outbreak, it is particularly important to gain a better understanding of the epidemiological determinants characterizing the risk of MERS death in order to predict the heterogeneous risk of death in medical settings. We have devised a novel statistical model that identifies the risk of MERS death during the outbreak in real time. While accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death, risk factors for death were identified using a linear predictor tied to a logit model. We employ this approach to (1) quantify the risks of death and (2) characterize the temporal evolution of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as case ascertainment greatly improved during the course of the outbreak. Results: Senior persons aged 60 years or over were found to be 9.3 times (95 % confidence interval (CI), 5.3-16.9) more likely to die compared to younger MERS cases. Patients under treatment were at a 7.8-fold (95 % CI, 4.0-16.7) significantly higher risk of death compared to other MERS cases. The CFR among patients aged 60 years or older under treatment was estimated at 48.2 % (95 % CI, 35.2-61.3) as of July 31, 2015, while the CFR among other cases was estimated to lie below 15 %. From June 6, 2015, onwards, the CFR declined 0.3-fold (95 % CI, 0.1-1.1) compared to the earlier epidemic period, which may perhaps reflect enhanced case ascertainment following major contact tracing efforts. Conclusions: The risk of MERS death was significantly associated with older age as well as treatment for underlying diseases after explicitly adjusting for the delay between illness onset and death. Because MERS outbreaks are greatly amplified in the healthcare setting, enhanced infection control practices in medical facilities should strive to shield risk groups from MERS exposure.","meta":{"paper_id":"4bdb53b23deb0bc56d0aa7b26551ab76b1fd082e","title":"Real-time characterization of risks of death associated with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea, 2015"}}

Although the recent re-emergence of human rabies in China was noted in several epidemiological studies, little attention was paid to the reasons behind this phenomenon paralleling the findings of the previous reports. The purpose of this study is thus first to characterize the current trends of human rabies in China from 1990 to 2007, and then to define better recommendations for improving the postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) schedules delivered to rabies patients. The most updated epidemiological data for 22527 human rabies cases from January 1990 to July 2007, retrieved from the surveillance database of reportable diseases managed by the Ministry of Health of China, were analysed. To investigate the efficiency for the post-exposure treatment of rabies, the details of 244 rabies patients, including their anti-rabies treatment of injuries or related incidents, were ascertained in Guangdong provincial jurisdiction.

{"text":"Background: In the 2003 Toronto SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV was transmitted in hospitals despite adherence to infection control procedures. Considerable controversy resulted regarding which procedures and behaviours were associated with the greatest risk of SARS-CoV transmission. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify risk factors for transmission of SARS-CoV during intubation from laboratory confirmed SARS patients to HCWs involved in their care. All SARS patients requiring intubation during the Toronto outbreak were identified. All HCWs who provided care to intubated SARS patients during treatment or transportation and who entered a patient room or had direct patient contact from 24 hours before to 4 hours after intubation were eligible for this study. Data was collected on patients by chart review and on HCWs by intervieweradministered questionnaire. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) logistic regression models and classification and regression trees (CART) were used to identify risk factors for SARS transmission. Results: 45 laboratory-confirmed intubated SARS patients were identified. Of the 697 HCWs involved in their care, 624 (90%) participated in the study. SARS-CoV was transmitted to 26 HCWs from 7 patients; 21 HCWs were infected by 3 patients. In multivariate GEE logistic regression models, presence in the room during fiberoptic intubation (OR = 2.79, p = .004) or ECG (OR = 3.52, p = .002), unprotected eye contact with secretions (OR = 7.34, p = .001), patient APACHE II score $20 (OR = 17.05, p = .009) and patient Pa0 2 \/Fi0 2 ratio #59 (OR = 8.65, p = .001) were associated with increased risk of transmission of SARS-CoV. In CART analyses, the four covariates which explained the greatest amount of variation in SARS-CoV transmission were covariates representing individual patients. Conclusion: Close contact with the airway of severely ill patients and failure of infection control practices to prevent exposure to respiratory secretions were associated with transmission of SARS-CoV.

{"text":"Post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) is one of the most serious threats for the swine industry worldwide. It is commonly associated with the proliferation of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli in the pig intestine. Colistin, a cationic antibiotic, is widely used in swine for the oral treatment of intestinal infections caused by E. coli, and particularly of PWD. However, despite the effectiveness of this antibiotic in the treatment of PWD, several studies have reported high rates of colistin resistant E. coli in swine. Furthermore, this antibiotic is considered of very high importance in humans, being used for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Moreover, the recent discovery of the mcr-1 gene encoding for colistin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae on a conjugative stable plasmid has raised great concern about the possible loss of colistin effectiveness for the treatment of MDR-GNB in humans. Consequently, it has been proposed that the use of colistin in animal production should be considered as a last resort treatment only. Thus, to overcome the economic losses, which would result from the restriction of use of colistin, especially for prophylactic purposes in PWD control, we believe that an understanding of the factors contributing to the development of this disease and the putting in place of practical alternative strategies for the control of PWD in swine is crucial. Such alternatives should improve animal gut health and reduce economic losses in pigs without promoting bacterial resistance. The present review begins with an overview of risk factors of PWD and an update of colistin use in PWD control worldwide in terms of quantities and microbiological outcomes. Subsequently, alternative strategies to the use of colistin for the control of this disease are described and discussed. Finally, a practical approach for the control of PWD in its various phases is proposed.","meta":{"paper_id":"fa6b3fafeedf308826d58db91499b7c09f172310","title":"Post weaning diarrhea in pigs: risk factors and non-colistin-based control strategies"}}
{"text":"Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R t ) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R t were examined using linear regression. R t usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1-1.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R t . We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R t (coefficients ranged from \u22120.14 to \u22120.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) causes a substantial disease burden in Asian regions including Hong Kong, mainly in children below 5 years of age 1-4 . Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and coxsackievirus A6 (CA6) are the most common enterovirus serotypes causing HFMD in Hong Kong 2,5 . HFMD has a clear seasonal pattern in temperate regions with annual peaks in the summer 1,6 , while in tropical and subtropical regions including Hong Kong, multiple peaks may occur within a year 2,7 . Inconsistent findings about the associations between meteorological factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, and the incidence of HFMD were reported by different studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . HFMD is considered to be transmitted mainly through direct contact with contaminated discharges, fluid of blisters or stool from infected persons, or contaminated objects 16 . Attending kindergarten or child-care center and visiting public playground were also reported as risk factors for HFMD [17] [18] [19] . HFMD is highly transmissible, with a basic reproduction number (R 0 ) ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 for different serotypes in Hong Kong and Singapore 20,21 . A temperature of 21.1 to 26.7 \u00b0C, higher relative humidity and school period were reported to be associated with higher HFMD transmission in mainland China 22 . Other factors, such as host susceptibility and virus-specific transmissibility were also found to play vital roles in transmission of infectious diseases 23 . Currently, there is a lack of evidence about the potential risk factors and their impact on HFMD transmission. This study therefore aims to examine the transmissibility of HFMD and its potential driving factors in Hong Kong, where HFMD shows less obvious seasonality.","meta":{"paper_id":"7ba06e5c566af08208ee7d87cc8a0d6c2b772b9e","title":"Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong"}}
{"text":"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient cells are highly susceptible to viral infection. This study examined the mechanism underlying this phenomenon by measuring the expression of antiviral genes-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1)-in G6PD-knockdown cells upon human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection. Molecular analysis revealed that the promoter activities of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 were downregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells, and that the I\u03baB degradation and DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB were decreased. The HSCARG protein, a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) sensor and negative regulator of NF-\u03baB, was upregulated in G6PD-knockdown cells with decreased NADPH\/NADP + ratio. Treatment of G6PD-knockdown cells with siRNA against HSCARG enhanced the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB and the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1, but suppressed the expression of viral genes; however, the overexpression of HSCARG inhibited the antiviral response. Exogenous G6PD or IDH1 expression inhibited the expression of HSCARG, resulting in increased expression of TNF-\u03b1 and MX1 and reduced viral gene expression upon virus infection. Our findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of the G6PD-knockdown cells to viral infection was due to impaired NF-\u03baB signaling and antiviral response mediated by HSCARG. Viruses 2015, 7, 6689-6706 deficiency predisposes cells to increased oxidative stress. G6PD-knockdown cells exhibit premature senescence, growth retardation, and increased susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis [4] [5] [6] . Clinically, in addition to the classical association with hemolytic anemia [7, 8] , patients with G6PD-deficiency have an increased risk of degenerative diseases [9] [10] [11] [12] . G6PD-deficient cells are more susceptible to enterovirus, coronavirus, and dengue virus infections [13] [14] [15] . These findings suggest that the G6PD status, and hence the redox environment, is a risk factor for viral infection. The mechanism underlying the effect of the redox environment on viral replication remains elusive. Viral replication and spread is inhibited by the antiviral defense mechanisms of the host. The replication and spread normally involves activation of the antiviral innate immune responses and culminates in the production of type I interferons (IFNs) [16] and proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) [17, 18] . Both IFNs and TNF-\u03b1 are antiviral cytokines and display strong antiviral activity in host innate immunity [19] . Type I IFNs are the principal antiviral cytokines produced during the innate immune responses to viral infections, and upregulate antiviral proteins [20] [21] [22] . More than 300 IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which are initiated by type I IFN signaling, have been discovered. Some ISG-encoded proteins, such as GTPase myxovirus resistance 1 (MX1) [23], protein kinase R (PKR) [24], and 2 1 -5 1 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) [25] , are implicated in the antiviral state. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in many cellular processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and signal transduction [30] [31] [32] . ROS have also been shown to trigger the signaling process of innate immune responses [33, 34] . Oxidative stress affects viral replication partly by altering host immunity [35, 36] . The inhibitory effect of the G6PD status on viral replication is unknown, which can be attributed to the alteration of the host innate immune response from modulating the redox homeostasis of the host cells. HSCARG, also called NMRAL1, is an NADPH sensor; changes in the NADPH\/NADP + ratio can induce allosteric change and the subcellular redistribution of HSCARG [37, 38] . HSCARG regulates the proteolysis of RelA and the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b2 [39] and plays an essential role in NF-\u03baB signaling [39] [40] [41] . Moreover, HSCARG suppresses the TNF-\u03b1-stimulated activation of NF-\u03baB [40] , suggesting that the NADPH\/NADP + ratio or the redox status affects the NF-\u03baB-mediated immune response through the modulation of HSCARG. HSCARG can inhibit TRAF3 ubiquitination and negatively regulate the cellular antiviral response [42] . Because of the crucial role of G6PD in maintaining cellular NADPH\/NADP + , examining the relationship among the G6PD status, HSCARG, and host innate immune response is worthwhile. This study addresses how the G6PD status affects the innate immune response to viral infection. The expression of viral genes is substantially higher in G6PD-knockdown cells infected with human coronavirus strain 229E (HCoV-229E) and EV71 than in infected control cells. The expression of antiviral genes, such as MX1 and TNF-\u03b1, is upregulated, albeit to lower levels, in G6PD deficient cells. HSCARG, whose expression is enhanced in G6PD-deficient cells, inhibits I\u03baB degradation and the DNA binding activity of NF-\u03baB. Exogenous G6PD or isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which increases cellular NADPH\/NADP + , restores NF-\u03baB-mediated antiviral response. These findings demonstrate that G6PD activity, and hence NADPH\/NADP + status, can affect antiviral immunity through the modulation of HSCARG and the NF-\u03baB signaling cascade.","meta":{"paper_id":"e2b5298da8d9d86daf286304637a644139dc6dc1","title":"Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Enhances Antiviral Response through Downregulation of NADPH Sensor HSCARG and Upregulation of NF-\u03baB Signaling"}}

We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. Methods. Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. Results. Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3-286.5) per 1000 person-years, and was more than twice as high among nonneonates than among neonates (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52-4.21). HCoV ARI incidence was also positively associated with the number of children <5 years of age per room in a household (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28).

{"text":"Acute viral wheeze in children is a major cause of hospitalisation and a major risk factor for the development of asthma. However, the role of the respiratory tract microbiome in the development of acute wheeze is unclear. To investigate whether severe wheezing episodes in children are associated with bacterial dysbiosis in the respiratory tract, oropharyngeal swabs were collected from 109 children with acute wheezing attending the only tertiary paediatric hospital in Perth, Australia. The bacterial community from these samples was explored using next generation sequencing and compared to samples from 75 non-wheezing controls. No significant difference in bacterial diversity was observed between samples from those with wheeze and healthy controls. Within the wheezing group, attendance at kindergarten or preschool was however, associated with increased bacterial diversity. Rhinovirus (RV) infection did not have a significant effect on bacterial community composition. A significant difference in bacterial richness was observed between children with RV-A and RV-C infection, however this is likely due to the differences in age group between the patient cohorts. The bacterial community within the oropharynx was found to be diverse and heterogeneous. Age and attendance at day care or kindergarten were important factors in driving bacterial diversity.

{"text":"Background: Cats with feline calicivirus (FCV)-related symptoms are commonly presented to veterinary practitioners. Various clinical manifestations have been attributed to FCV, i.e. upper respiratory tract disease (URTD), oral ulcerations, gingivostomatitis, limping syndrome and virulent systemic disease. Additionally, healthy cats can shed FCV. The aims of this study were 1) to investigate the frequency of FCV in cats with FCV-related symptoms and in healthy cats in Switzerland, 2) to assess risk and protective factors for infection, such as signalment, housing conditions, vaccination, and co-infection with URTD-associated pathogens, and 3) to address the association between clinical symptoms and FCV infection. Results: Oropharyngeal, nasal and conjunctival swabs were collected in 24 veterinary practices from 200 FCV-suspect and 100 healthy cats originating from 19 cantons of Switzerland. The samples were tested for FCV using virus isolation and reverse-transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and for feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), Mycoplasma felis, Chlamydophila felis, Bordetella bronchiseptica using real-time qPCR. Within the two populations (FCVsuspect\/healthy), the observed PCR prevalences were: FCV 45 %\/8 %, FHV-1 20 %\/9 %, C. felis 8 %\/1 %, B. bronchiseptica 4 %\/2 %, M. felis 47 %\/31 % and any co-infections thereof 40 %\/14 %. Based on multivariable regression models amongst FCV-suspect cats (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval]), co-infection with M. felis (1.75 [0.97; 3.14]), group housing (2.11 [1.02; 4.34]) and intact reproductive status (1.80 [0.99; 3.28]) were found to be risk factors for FCV infection. In healthy cats, intact reproductive status (22.2 [1.85; 266.7]) and group housing (46.4 [5.70; 377.7]) were found to be associated with FCV infection. Based on an univariable approach, FCV-suspect cats were found to be significantly less often FCV-positive when vaccinated (0.48 [0.24; 0.94]). Oral ulcerations, salivation, gingivitis and stomatitis, but not classical signs of URTD were significantly associated with FCV infection (all p < 0.001). Conclusions: FCV was detected in less than half of the cats that were judged FCV-suspect by veterinary practitioners. For a clinical diagnosis, FCV-related symptoms should be revisited. FCV infection was present in some healthy cats, underlining the importance of asymptomatic carriers in FCV epidemiology. To reduce FCV-related problems in multicat environments, reduction of group size in addition to the generally recommended vaccination are advocated.","meta":{"paper_id":"3dc77148a29d1caf25a7a345f04d61d160385734","title":"Feline calicivirus and other respiratory pathogens in cats with Feline calicivirus- related symptoms and in clinically healthy cats in Switzerland"}}
{"text":"Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary events, heart and renal failure, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in its pathogenesis. Within the RAS, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin (Ang) I into the vasoconstrictor Ang II. An \"alternate\" arm of the RAS now exists in which ACE2 counterbalances the effects of the classic RAS through degradation of Ang II, and generation of the vasodilator Ang 1-7. ACE2 is highly expressed in the heart, blood vessels, and kidney. The catalytically active ectodomain of ACE2 undergoes shedding, resulting in ACE2 in the circulation. The ACE2 gene maps to a quantitative trait locus on the X chromosome in three strains of genetically hypertensive rats, suggesting that ACE2 may be a candidate gene for hypertension. It is hypothesized that disruption of tissue ACE\/ACE2 balance results in changes in blood pressure, with increased ACE2 expression protecting against increased blood pressure, and ACE2 deficiency contributing to hypertension. Experimental hypertension studies have measured ACE2 in either the heart or kidney and\/or plasma, and have reported that deletion or inhibition of ACE2 leads to hypertension, whilst enhancing ACE2 protects against the development of hypertension, hence increasing ACE2 may be a therapeutic option for the management of high blood pressure in man. There have been relatively few studies of ACE2, either at the gene or the circulating level in patients with hypertension. Plasma ACE2 activity is low in healthy subjects, but elevated in patients with cardiovascular risk factors or cardiovascular disease. Genetic studies have investigated ACE2 gene polymorphisms with either hypertension or blood pressure, and have produced largely inconsistent findings. This review discusses the evidence regarding ACE2 in experimental hypertension models and the association between circulating ACE2 activity and ACE2 polymorphisms with blood pressure and arterial hypertension in man.","meta":{"paper_id":"b7f529b58714037f09a19f78d9a06d68f1f15dd9","title":"From gene to protein-experimental and clinical studies of ACE2 in blood pressure control and arterial hypertension"}}
{"text":"Background: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infectious disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country. Special attention must be paid to CAP in Southeast Asia (SEA), a region facing rapid demographic transition. Estimates burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential for the clinical and public health management. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence, aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the Vietnamese adult population. Methods: A prospective surveillance for hospitalised adult CAP was conducted in Khanh Hoa Province, Central Vietnam. All adults aged \u226515 years with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR. Results: Of all 367 LRTI episodes examined, 174 (47%) were CAP. Older age, the presence of underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients was 9.8%. Among 286 sputum samples tested for bacterial PCR, 79 (28%) were positive for H. influenzae, and 65 (23%) were positive for S. pneumoniae. Among 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses; influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common. Conclusions: The current adult CAP incidence in Vietnam was relatively low; this result was mainly attributed to the young age of our study population.","meta":{"paper_id":"1e7e3df5deec55ed5c2fa7f9cba8854c6aeb7ab6","title":"The incidence and aetiology of hospitalised community-acquired pneumonia among Vietnamese adults: a prospective surveillance in Central Vietnam"}}
{"text":"Background: To date, there is little information that reflects the true extent of spread of the pH1N1\/2009v influenza pandemic at the community level as infection often results in mild or no clinical symptoms. This study aimed at assessing through a prospective study, the attack rate of pH1N1\/2009 virus in Reunion Island and risk factors of infection, during the 2009 season. Methodology\/Principal Findings: A serosurvey was conducted during the 2009 austral winter, in the frame of a prospective population study. Pairs of sera were collected from 1687 individuals belonging to 772 households, during and after passage of the pandemic wave. Antibodies to pH1N1\/2009v were titered using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) with titers $1\/40 being considered positive. Seroprevalence during the first two weeks of detection of pH1N1\/2009v in Reunion Island was 29.8% in people under 20 years of age, 35.6% in adults (20-59 years) and 73.3% in the elderly ($60 years) (P,0.0001). Baseline corrected cumulative incidence rates, were 42.9%, 13.9% and 0% in these age groups respectively (P,0.0001). A significant decline in antibody titers occurred soon after the passage of the epidemic wave. Seroconversion rates to pH1N1\/2009 correlated negatively with age: 63.2%, 39.4% and 16.7%, in each age group respectively (P,0.0001). Seroconversion occurred in 65.2% of individuals who were seronegative at inclusion compared to 6.8% in those who were initially seropositive. Conclusions: Seroincidence of pH1N1\/2009v infection was three times that estimated from clinical surveillance, indicating that almost two thirds of infections occurring at the community level have escaped medical detection. People under 20 years of age were the most affected group. Pre-epidemic titers $1\/40 prevented seroconversion and are likely protective against infection. A concern was raised about the long term stability of the antibody responses.","meta":{"paper_id":"ee6d70a53e3262cea6f85bd8b226f6b4c8b5f64b","title":"Pandemic Influenza Due to pH1N1\/2009 Virus: Estimation of Infection Burden in Reunion Island through a Prospective Serosurvey, Austral Winter 2009"}}
{"text":"Background: Age and breed are considered the greatest risk factors for disease prevalence and mortality in companion dogs. Understanding the prevalence of diseases, in relation to age and breed, would support appropriate guidance for future health care strategies and provide useful information for the early diagnosis of diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the major medical causes for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea, stratified by age and breed. Methods: A total of 15,531 medical records of canine patients were analyzed from 11 veterinary clinics who shared data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. An electronic medical record (EMR) system was used for data collection, which included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information, and diagnosis. EMR data were classified using the International Classification of Disease system from the World Health Organization; presenting signs or diagnoses were identified according to breed and life stage. Results: Within the age groups, preventive medicine (16.7% confidence intervals (CI) [15.9-17.5]) was the most common cause for clinic visits for the <1 year and 1-3 year groups. Additionally, neutering surgery (6.6% CI [6.0-7.1]) and patella luxation (1.4% CI [1.8-2.7]) were frequently performed in these age groups. In the 4-6 year group, otitis externa (8.8% CI [7.8-10.0]) and dermatitis or eczema (8.5% CI [7.5-9.6]) were common medical problems. In older dogs (>10 year), the prevalences of heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing's disease, and mammary tumors were higher than in the other age groups. Small and toy breed dogs comprised 67.7% of all dogs in this analysis. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems. Discussion: This study identified the most common medical disorders and differences in prevalences of diseases, according to age and breeds. The information from EMRs for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics can provide background knowledge that is required to enable a better understanding of disease patterns and occurrence by age and breeds.

{"text":"Considering the high morbidity of hepatitis B in China, many epidemiological studies based on classic medical statistical analysis have been started but lack spatial information. However, spatial information such as the spatial distribution, autocorrelation and risk factors of the disease is of great help in studying patients with hepatitis B. This study examined 2851 cases of hepatitis B that were hospitalized in Shenzhen in 2010 and studied the spatial distribution, risk factors and spatial access to health services using spatial interpolation, Pearson correlation analysis and the improved two-step floating catchment area method. The results showed that the spatial distribution of hepatitis B, along with risk factors as well as spatial access to the regional medical resources, was uneven and mainly concentrated in the south and southwest of Shenzhen in 2010. In addition, the distribution characteristics of hepatitis B revealed a positive correlation between four types of service establishments and risk factors for the disease. The Pearson correlation coefficients are 0.566, 0.515, 0.626, 0.538 corresponding to bath centres, beauty OPEN ACCESS salons, massage parlours and pedicure parlours (p < 0.05). Additionally, the allocation of medical resources for hepatitis B is adequate, as most patients could be treated at nearby hospitals. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is one of the most common viral infections in the world, leading to many deaths each year from associated liver diseases [1, 2] . HBV is also an important public health issue in China [2], as national surveys conducted since the 1970s have repeatedly showed high morbidity from HBV infections in the general population [3, 4] . To address this challenge, many scholars now to study the disease using different approaches (e.g., pathology, immunology and epidemiology), but none of these approaches incorporate spatial information [5] . With the development of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and its applications in epidemiology [6], it has become clear the spatial information has great value in Epidemiology. Spatial epidemiology is a branch of epidemiology that uses spatial information to extend the analysis of disease distribution and risk factors. This information serves as a powerful analytical tool for epidemiological studies and will likely show greater significance in the future [7]. Our team have done some works on spatial epidemiology [8-10]. Using geographic information systems and spatial analysis technology, spatial epidemiology attempts to describe and analyze human diseases, including the spatial distribution characteristics of health and hygiene events as well as the regularity of changes and developments. Spatial epidemiology also explores the decisive elements that can impact public health and provides strategies and measures for disease prevention and cure and health promotion and hygiene services [7, 11] . Research on this subject mainly utilizes four elements: disease mapping, risk assessment in relation to a point or line source, disease clustering analysis and geographical correlation studies [11] . Disease mapping is the most important tool in spatial epidemiology and is used to describe and evaluate disease area distribution [7]. The most typical example of disease mapping is the epidemiological investigation of a cholera outbreak caused by street water pollution in London in 1854 [12, 13] . The assessment of risk factors is similar to geographical correlation studies in that they both focus on studying cause of geographical phenomenon. Moreover, analysis of disease clustering uses statistical methods to identify disease spatial aggregation, thus providing corresponding methods to search for etiologic clues [7, 14, 15] . Among the four study elements, disease mapping and disease clustering analysis are relatively mature, and typical methods and models, such as spatial interpolation and spatial scan statistics are commonly used [16] [17] [18] . However, exploring the risk factors for disease is complex and difficult, especially for diseases in which it is difficult to obtain patient exposure information, and data involving patients' privacy [7] ; this challenge represents a weak link in epidemiological studies. Compared with other infectious diseases such as schistosomiasis [19, 20] , most respiratory system diseases [21] and cardiovascular diseases [8], the spatial risk factors for hepatitis B are less obvious, and there have been few studies on this aspect. In view of this problem, this study sought to explore the spatial risk factors for hepatitis B and to discover the relationship between these risk factors and hepatitis B morbidity.","meta":{"paper_id":"063f48cf2d9b53b075433f3bd1a63566feb240db","title":"Spatial Analysis of the Distribution, Risk Factors and Access to Medical Resources of Patients with Hepatitis B in Shenzhen, China"}}

{"text":"The Great East Japan Earthquakes of March 11, 2011 caused immense harm to the community and subsequent nuclear accident in Fukushima Prefecture extended the damage. Local residents were forced to evacuated without pets and the left behind animals were rescued from the restricted zone one month later. Unplanned animal rescue and unregulated sheltering caused secondary damage to animals such as disease epidemics at impounded animal shelter. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the incidence of upper respiratory infection (URI) and diarrhea in cats at the first response animal shelter in Fukushima, and investigate factors affecting the duration of disease and determinants of treatments performed. Eighty percent and 59% of impounded cats developed URI, 71% and 54% of cats developed diarrhea, and 91% and 83% of cats had at least one disease in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Uses of multiple drug administration (more than five drugs) was associated with prolonged URI and diarrhea. Multiple antibiotics, antihistamines, interferon, and steroids were associated with relapse of and prolonged URI. Developing a standardized treatment protocol for commonly observed diseases at Japanese animal shelters to prevent and control diseases, to promote animal welfare, and protect public health in the face of future disasters is overdue. did not allow animals, so dogs and cats accompanying owners were either brought to the Ihno shelter or transferred to neighboring animal hospitals. The animal rescue operation originally focused on searching for companion animals in the restricted zone, and was incepted based upon pressure from pet owners forced to abandon their pets. The consequences of abandonment included: animal starvation, emaciation, and death; illegal entry to feed or reclaim animals with resultant exposure to unsafe radiation levels; uncontrolled animal reproduction; and harm to the area's ecosystem. The animal rescue operation in Fukushima took place for more than four years (and ended in December 31, 2015) due to the ongoing nuclear emergency at the power plant, while temporary animal shelters located in the disaster regions affected by the tsunami and earthquakes (Miyagi prefecture) closed mostly within six months. The Ihno shelter was initially established at a warehouse and was unsuitable for sheltering dogs and cats for a prolonged time; therefore, a second shelter was built in Miharu, Fukushima, and all animals were transferred there in January 2013. Because the animal rescue operation time was lengthy, it evolved through two phases. The initial chaotic phase suffered from lack of infrastructure, resources, and competent staff, exaggerating an already stressful situation. In the first seven months of the initial phase, there were no guidelines or protocols for managing animals at the shelter, different volunteer veterinarians engaged in the care of animals each day, and infectious diseases were extremely common. The second phase was far more stable: most of the animals were tamed, socialized, and experienced a low incidence of disease. The primary health issue reported for cats at animal shelters was upper respiratory infection (URI) [1] [2] [3] [4] . The inherent properties of animal shelters, which include a constant influx of animals without medical backgrounds or vaccination histories, overcrowding, lack of quarantine or isolation facilities, poor hygiene, loud noise, housing with dogs, confinement to cages, and extremely stressful environments, act as risk factors for endemic infectious diseases [1, [4] [5] [6] . Although the prevalence of causative agents is shelter-specific[7-9], the majority of URI is caused by feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline calicivirus (FCV), Bordetella bronchiseptica, Chlamydophila felis, and Mycoplasma species [4, 10, 11] . Apparently healthy cats can be carriers for all of these agents; this and the risk that shelters pose make control of URI extremely difficult in the absence of standardized protocols for disease prevention and management. Diarrhea is also a common disease in sheltered cats; the causes are multifactorial, including stress, diet, and viral, protozoal, bacterial, or helminthic infection[11, 12]. It also shares common risk factors with URI in shelters, including crowding, stress, poor hygiene practice, and asymptomatic shedding cats [5, 12] . Although causative agents for URI and diarrhea and risk factors for disease development are known, shelters do not necessarily have the resources to establish definitive diagnoses, and symptomatically treating cats without validated guidelines for shelter management will not necessarily resolve clinical illness or prevent the spread of infectious disease if the risk factors go uncontrolled. In this research, a retrospective epidemiological evaluation of sheltered cats was performed to investigate feline health status and treatment protocols during the first and second years at the Ihno, Japan shelter. The incidences of URI and diarrhea were compared between the first and second years, and related to factors predictive of disease duration and frequency, including choice of treatment options.","meta":{"paper_id":"9ac7ff68cae35ddd75b3e7ca8d267ac78d46daa6","title":"Epidemiological evaluation of cat health at a first-response animal shelter in Fukushima, following the Great East Japan Earthquakes of 2011"}}
{"text":"Mask ventilation and coughing during oro-tracheal suctioning produce aerosols that enhance nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections. We examined the extent of exhaled air dispersion from a human-patient-simulator during mask ventilation by different groups of healthcare workers and coughing bouts. The simulator was programmed to mimic varying severity of lung injury. Exhaled airflow was marked with tiny smoke particles, and highlighted by laser light-sheet. We determined the normalized exhaled air concentration in the leakage jet plume from the light scattered by smoke particles. Smoke concentration \u226520% was considered as significant exposure. Exhaled air leaked from mask-face interface in the transverse plane was most severe (267 \u00b1 44 mm) with Ambu silicone resuscitator performed by nurses. Dispersion was however similar among anesthesiologists\/ intensivists, respiratory physicians and medical students using Ambu or Laerdal silicone resuscitator, p = 0.974. The largest dispersion was 860 \u00b1 93 mm during normal coughing effort without tracheal intubation and decreased with worsening coughing efforts. Oro-tracheal suctioning reduced dispersion significantly, p < 0.001, and was more effective when applied continuously. Skills to ensure good fit during mask ventilation are important in preventing air leakage through the mask-face interface. Continuous oro-tracheal suctioning minimized exhaled air dispersion during coughing bouts when performing aerosol-generating procedures. Respiratory failure is a serious complication of emerging infectious respiratory diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 1,2 , avian influenza 3 , influenza A(H1N1)2009 infection 4 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 5 . Supplemental oxygen, non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and occasionally invasive mechanical ventilation are required for managing these patients 1-5 . During the major outbreak of SARS, it was found that procedures related to tracheal intubation 6 , oxygen administration \u22656 L\/min, and NIV were independent risk factors for super-spreading nosocomial outbreaks affecting many healthcare workers in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China 7 . In a systematic review of aerosol generating procedures that might increase the risk of nosocomial transmission of SARS to healthcare workers, mask ventilation and oro-tracheal suctioning increased the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals, CI) to 2.8 (1.3-6.4) and 6.2 (2.2-18.1), respectively 8 . In this respect, we have previously shown that the dispersion distances of exhaled plume along the sagittal and transverse planes were 200 and 220 mm, respectively, when bag-mask ventilation was attempted in a human-patient-simulator (HPS) 9 . Although the addition of a viral-bacterial filter eliminated forward leakage of exhaled air from the expiration diverter, leakage at the interface between the mask and the patient's face was increased to 340 mm along the transverse plane. It is unclear if the increased leakage along the transverse plane was due to the higher resistance with the filter or related to inefficient mask seal 9 . In addition, oro-tracheal suctioning may trigger coughing bouts that could further increase the spread of potentially infectious droplets. However, effective suction may limit the dispersion. Further studies are therefore required to examine if there are technical or human factors involved that","meta":{"paper_id":"2bd1d7992ad099b99b495fdd79493a00210bcbe0","title":"Exhaled air dispersion during bag- mask ventilation and sputum suctioning -Implications for infection control OPEN"}}
{"text":"Pneumonitis is the leading cause of death associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the risk factors and the mechanism underlying this toxicity have not been elucidated. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been reported to transactivate EGFR in pulmonary epithelial cells. Hence, we aimed to test the hypothesis that EGFR tyrosine kinase activity regulates TNF-mediated bronchial epithelial cell survival, and that inhibition of EGFR activity increases TNF-induced lung epithelial cell apoptosis. We used surfactant protein C (SPC)-TNF transgenic (tg) mice which overexpress TNF in the lungs. In this model, gefitinib, an EGFR-TKI, enhanced lung epithelial cell apoptosis and lymphocytic inflammation, indicating that EGFR tyrosine kinase prevents TNF-induced lung injury. Furthermore, IL-17A was significantly upregulated by gefitinib in SPC-TNF tg mice and p38MAPK activation was observed, indicative of a pathway involved in lung epithelial cell apoptosis. Moreover, in lung epithelial cells, BEAS-2B, TNF stimulated EGFR transactivation via the TNF-\u03b1-converting enzyme in a manner that requires heparin binding (HB)-EGF and transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b1. These novel findings have significant implications in understanding the role of EGFR in maintaining human bronchial epithelial cell homeostasis and in NSCLC treatment.","meta":{"paper_id":"e3f168287dc3669b48862c0e70e000fc49edf00a","title":"Blockade of EGFR Activation Promotes TNF-Induced Lung Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Pulmonary Injury"}}
{"text":"Steroid treatment has become recognized as an important risk factor for avascular osteonecrosis of the femoral head. However, not all patients who receive long-term, high-dose steroids develop osteonecrosis, indicating that there are individual differences in occurrence. We explored the relationship between polymorphisms and steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (SONFH) incidence with variables. We used a multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression model, which is an expansion of logistic regression, for each type of steroid, primary disease, drug dose, applied duration, and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). We also conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to analyze the cumulative dosage and SONFH risk in mutation carriers. There were significant correlations between the ABCB1 rs1045642 mutant and SONFH in the prednisone-use and methylprednisolone\/prednisone-use populations. The ABCB1 rs2032582 mutant homozygote had a protective effect in the methylprednisolone\/prednisolone renal transplant population. For ApoB rs693, mutation increased the incidence of SONFH in prednisone-use and methylprednisolone\/prednisolone-use populations and renal transplant patients. For ApoB rs1042031, mutation increased the risk of SONFH in the prednisone-use population. The PAI-1 rs1799768 mutation had a protective effect on the SONFH risk prednisone-use and renal transplant populations. ABCB1 rs1045642 mutations have a protective effect against SONFH, and ApoB rs693 and rs1042031 increase the SONFH risk. Cumulative dosage and treatment duration had little effect on the results.

{"text":"Viral infection is one of the risk factors for asthma exacerbation. However, which pathogens are related to asthma exacerbation in adults remains unclear. The relation between various infections and adult asthma exacerbations was investigated in clinical practice. The study subjects included 50 adult inpatients due to asthma exacerbations and 20 stable outpatients for comparison. The pathogens from a nasopharyngeal swab were measured by multiplex PCR analysis. Asthma exacerbations occurred after a common cold in 48 inpatients. The numbers of patients with viral, bacterial, or both infections were 16, 9, and 9, respectively. The dominant viruses were rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, and metapneumovirus. The major bacteria were S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Compared to pathogen-free patients, the patients with pathogens were older and non-atopic and had later onset of disease, lower FeNO levels, lower IgE titers, and a higher incidence of comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia. Compared to stable outpatients, asthma exacerbation inpatients had a higher incidence of smoking and comorbid sinusitis, COPD, or pneumonia.

{"text":"Simple Summary: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, diminishing hen welfare and production performance, and negatively affecting sustainability. Beak trimming is a common practice to control these problems, but in Finland beak trimming is prohibited. Finnish egg producers have decades-long experience of egg production with intact-beaked hens. This experience, and their management of pecking-related problems, could benefit producers in other countries. The online questionnaire aimed to gather information about Finnish farmers' attitudes towards beak trimming, their estimation of the seriousness of pecking problems in their laying hen flocks, common risk factors and the best practices to prevent attendant problems. The questionnaire received 35 responses. Finnish egg producers appeared strongly to support a policy of not trimming beaks. Motivation against beak trimming was explained by considering it to be unnecessary and unethical. Most respondents did not regard pecking-related problems as being very severe in their flocks. Lighting, feeding and flock management problems represented the most important risk factors regarding pecking problems. Generally, the same topics were highlighted as being the most important intervention measures for managing an on-going pecking problem. The study indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy as a component of sustainable egg production. Abstract: Pecking-related problems are common in intensive egg production, compromising hen welfare, causing farmers economic losses and negatively affecting sustainability. These problems are often controlled by beak trimming, which in Finland is prohibited. An online questionnaire aimed to collect information from farmers about pecking-related problems in Finnish laying hen flocks, important risk factors and the best experiences to prevent the problems. Additionally, the farmers' attitudes towards beak trimming were examined. We received 35 responses, which represents about 13% of all Finnish laying hen farms with \u2265300 laying hens. The majority of respondents stated that a maximum of 5-7% incidence of feather pecking or 1-2% incidence of cannibalism would be tolerable. The majority of respondents (74%) expressed that they would definitely not use beak-trimmed hens. Only two respondents indicated that they would probably use beak-trimmed hens were the practice permitted. Among risk factors, light intensity earned the highest mean (6.3), on a scale from 1 (not important) to 7 (extremely important). Other important problems included those that occurred during rearing, feeding, flock management and problems with drinking water equipment (mean 5.9, each). The most important intervention measures included optimal lighting and feeding, flock management, and removing the pecker and victim. Concluding, Finnish farmers had strong negative attitudes towards beak trimming. The study underlines the importance of flock management, especially lighting and feeding, in preventing pecking problems and indicates that it is possible to incorporate a non-beak-trimming policy into sustainable egg production.","meta":{"paper_id":"7dbe0bb2d5bfc8c90c1a0185c6ea608452b08276","title":"Feather Pecking and Cannibalism in Non-Beak- Trimmed Laying Hen Flocks-Farmers' Perspectives"}}

Although studies have been conducted on the frequency and risk factors associated with CDV infection, there are no comprehensive data on the current epidemiological magnitude in the domestic dog population at regional and national levels. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study and included our results in a meta-analysis to summarize and combine available data on the frequency and potential risk factors associated with CDV infection. For the cross-sectional study, biological samples from dogs suspected to have canine distemper (CD) were collected and screened for viral RNA. Briefly, the PRISMA protocol was used for the meta-analysis, and data analyses were performed using STATA IC 13.1 software. CDV RNA was detected in 34% (48\/141) of dogs suspected to have CD. Following our meta-analysis, 53 studies were selected for a total of 11,527 dogs. Overall, the pooled frequency of CDV positivity based on molecular and serological results were 33% (95% CI: 23-43) and 46% (95% CI: 36-57), respectively. The pooled subgroup analyses of clinical signs, types of biological samples, diagnostic methods and dog lifestyle had a wide range of CDV positivity (range 8-75%).

Notably, failure to detect these neoplasms at an early stage represents a fundamental barrier to improving the survival and quality of life of OSCC patients. In the present study, serum samples from OSCC patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 25) were subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and silver staining in order to identify biomarkers that might allow early diagnosis. In this regard, 2-DE spots corresponding to various up-and down-regulated proteins were sequenced via high-resolution MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and analyzed using the MASCOT database. We identified the following differentially expressed host-specific proteins within sera from OSCC patients: leucine-rich a2-glycoprotein (LRG), alpha-1-B-glycoprotein (ABG), clusterin (CLU), PRO2044, haptoglobin (HAP), complement C3c (C3), proapolipoprotein A1 (proapo-A1), and retinol-binding protein 4 precursor (RBP4). Moreover, five non-host factors were detected, including bacterial antigens from Acinetobacter lwoffii, Burkholderia multivorans, Myxococcus xanthus, Laribacter hongkongensis, and Streptococcus salivarius. Subsequently, we analyzed the immunogenicity of these proteins using pooled sera from OSCC patients. In this regard, five of these candidate biomarkers were found to be immunoreactive: CLU, HAP, C3, proapo-A1 and RBP4.

Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). Results: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle.

{"text":"The cattle industry is one of the most important Brazilian agribusiness sectors and is a strong contributor to the national economy. Annually about 44.6 million calves are bred, which makes the optimal management of these animals extremely important. Several diseases can affect the initial stages of the bovine production chain, being the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) one of the most relevant pathogens. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiology of BRSV infection in dairy cattle herds of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, using serological and risk factors analyses. For that, 1243 blood samples were collected of animals from 26 farms and a questionnaire about possible risk factors for BRSV prevalence was performed. The obtained blood sera were analyzed using virus neutralization test (VNT). Results: VNT results showed high BRSV prevalence in dairy cattle herds, reaching 79.5% of seropositivity. The BRSV seroprevalence among studied farms ranged from 40 to 100%. The analysis of risk factors indicated that the age group and the occurrence of coinfection with bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) should be associated with a higher prevalence of BRSV, while natural suckling was considered a protective factor. The study showed that adult animals over 1 year old are an important risk factor for the high seroprevalence of BRSV in herds. The high BRSV prevalence associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 suggests that biosecurity measures should be applied in order to reduce viral dissemination. Additionally, the natural suckling may be an important management to protect calves from high BRSV seroprevalence.","meta":{"paper_id":"923eca0b4175d09814a117b685e434c2f93bc25c","title":"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus seroprevalence and risk factors in non- vaccinated dairy cattle herds in Brazil"}}
{"text":"Objectives We used data from the Global Burden of Disease 2015 study (GBD) to calculate the burden of lower respiratory infections (LRIs) in the 22 countries of the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) from 1990 to 2015. Methods We conducted a systematic analysis of mortality and morbidity data for LRI and its specific etiologic factors, including pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus. We used modeling methods to estimate incidence, deaths, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). We calculated burden attributable to known risk factors for LRI. Results In 2015, LRIs were the fourth-leading cause of DALYs, causing 11,098,243 (95% UI 9,857,095-12,396,566) DALYs and 191,114 (95% UI 170,705) deaths. The LRI DALY rates were higher than global estimates in 2015. The highest and lowest age-standardized rates of DALYs were observed in Somalia and Lebanon, respectively. Undernutrition in childhood and ambient particulate matter air pollution in the elderly were the main risk factors. Conclusions Our findings call for public health strategies to reduce the level of risk factors in each age group, especially vulnerable child and elderly populations.","meta":{"paper_id":"ed638b6b8897dfcc7b28ba26c2bb6048da0501e6","title":"Benn Sartorius, PhD, Public Health Medicine, School of Nursing and Public Health"}}
{"text":"Bartonella spp. are globally distributed bacteria that cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals. Recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human Bartonella infections; however, the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown. Here we studied the genetic diversity, prevalence of infection across seasons and years, individual risk factors, and possible transmission routes of Bartonella in populations of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in Peru and Belize, for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported. Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA gene for a subset of PCR-positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to Bartonella described from vampire bats from Mexico, other Neotropical bat species, and streblid bat flies. Sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned Central and South America, implying limited spatial structure. Stable and nonzero Bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites. The odds of Bartonella infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism, but nearly all infected bats were infested, which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector-borne transmission. While metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of Bartonella DNA in pooled bat saliva and fecal samples, we detected PCR positivity in individual saliva and feces, suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact (i.e., biting) and environmental (i.e., fecal) exposures. Further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact, environmental, and vector-borne transmission for bat Bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https:\/\/doi. Bartonella are globally distributed bacteria that can cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals. Bats have been implicated as a likely reservoir host for these bacteria, but little is known about how prevalence varies over time, routes of transmission, and the genetic diversity of Bartonella in bats. We present results from a two-year, spatially replicated study of common vampire bats, which have previously shown high infection prevalence of Bartonella and could pose risks of cross-species transmission due to their diet of mammal blood. We found that vampire bat Bartonella is genetically diverse, geographically widespread and endemic, and that individual-level infection risk is highest for large, male, non-reproductive bats. Phylogenetic analysis supported vector-borne transmission, and we found support for potential transmission through direct contact and fecal exposures through PCR.

{"text":"Background: Data from prospectively planned cohort studies on risk of major clinical outcomes and prognostic factors for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus are limited. In 2009, in order to assess outcomes and evaluate risk factors for progression of illness, two cohort studies were initiated: FLU 002 in outpatients and FLU 003 in hospitalized patients. Methods and Findings: Between October 2009 and December 2012, adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) were enrolled; outpatients were followed for 14 days and inpatients for 60 days. Disease progression was defined as hospitalization and\/or death for outpatients, and hospitalization for .28 days, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward, and\/or death for inpatients. Infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. 590 FLU 002 and 392 FLU 003 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were enrolled from 81 sites in 17 countries at 2 days (IQR 1-3) and 6 days (IQR 4-10) following ILI onset, respectively. Disease progression was experienced by 29 (1 death) outpatients (5.1%; 95% CI: 3.4-7.2%) and 80 inpatients [death (32), hospitalization .28 days (43) or ICU transfer (20)] (21.6%; 95% CI: 17.5-26.2%). Disease progression (death) for hospitalized patients was 53.1% (26.6%) and 12.8% (3.8%), respectively, for those enrolled in the ICU and general ward. In pooled analyses for both studies, predictors of disease progression were age, longer duration of symptoms at enrollment and immunosuppression. Patients hospitalized during the pandemic period had a poorer prognosis than in subsequent seasons. Conclusions: Patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, particularly when requiring hospital admission, are at high risk for disease progression, especially if they are older, immunodeficient, or admitted late in infection. These data reinforce the need for international trials of novel treatment strategies for influenza infection and serve as a reminder of the need to monitor the severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza epidemics globally.","meta":{"paper_id":"0542a6ae26f57a5ffa35dcfebdec5004ff45688c","title":"Outcomes of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus Infection: Results from Two International Cohort Studies"}}
{"text":"Background: The epidemiology of New Neonatal Porcine Diarrhoea Syndrome (NNPDS) was studied in four selected herds. A total of 941 new born piglets in 86 litters were evaluated for five consecutive days. NNPDS is a newly emerged syndrome, characterized by diarrhoea within the first week of life, which is un-responsive to antibiotics and not associated with known pathogens. The aetiology behind the syndrome is unknown, and specific risk factors predisposing piglets to develop NNPDS also remain to be determined. The study evaluated sow and piglet-level risk factors for developing NNPDS and described the epidemiologic characteristics within four herds previously diagnosed with the syndrome. NNPDS was defined as diarrhoea at any time-point during the second to fifth day of life. Results: NNPDS was observed in a total of 60% (range: 39%-89%) of first parity piglets and 36% (range: 19-65%) of piglets born by mature sows. In total of 26% of piglets had liquid faeces on the day of birth. Approximately half of these piglets developed NNPDS. In the majority of cases (50-70% of cases within herds) symptoms started on the second or third day of life. Piglets in Herd 1 had12.8 times higher probability of developing NNPDS than piglets in Herd 4. First parity piglets had a 4.1 higher probability of developing NNPDS than piglets born by mature sows. Birth weight and faecal consistency on the day of birth were minor risk factors, each significant within one herd. Conclusions: The most important factors associated with NNPDS were herd of origin and sow-parity. The reason for one of the herds experiencing a considerably more severe outbreak than the others was not explained by factors addressed in this study. The epidemiological pattern of diarrhoea varied a lot between herds; however, in all herds first parity piglets seemed predisposed. This association may be explained by an infectious background of the syndrome, but further studies are needed to explain this association.","meta":{"paper_id":"a35a9ab63e50b5eed8710a67b89d6c31d53cd191","title":"Risk factors and epidemiological characteristics of new neonatal porcine diarrhoea syndrome in four Danish herds"}}
{"text":"Background: This study describes a model developed to evaluate the transboundary risk of PEDV-contaminated swine feed ingredients and the effect of two mitigation strategies during a simulated transport event from China to the US. Results: Ingredients imported to the USA from China, including organic & conventional soybeans and meal, lysine hydrochloride, D-L methionine, tryptophan, Vitamins A, D & E, choline, carriers (rice hulls, corn cobs) and feed grade tetracycline, were inoculated with PEDV. Control ingredients, and treatments (ingredients plus a liquid antimicrobial (SalCURB, Kemin Industries (LA) or a 2 % custom medium chain fatty acid blend (MCFA)) were tested. The model ran for 37 days, simulating transport of cargo from Beijing, China to Des Moines, IA, US from December 23, 2012 to January 28, 2013. To mimic conditions on land and sea, historical temperature and percent relative humidity (% RH) data were programmed into an environmental chamber which stored all containers. To evaluate PEDV viability over time, ingredients were organized into 1 of 4 batches of samples, each batch representing a specific segment of transport. Batch 1 (segment 1) simulated transport of contaminated ingredients from manufacturing plants in Beijing (day 1 post-contamination (PC)). Batch 2 (segments 1 and 2) simulated manufacturing and delivery to Shanghai, including time in Anquing terminal awaiting shipment (days 1-8 PC). Batch 3 (segments 1, 2 and 3) represented time in China, the crossing of the Pacific and entry to the US at the San Francisco, CA terminal (day 1-27 PC). Batch 4 (segments 1-4) represented the previous events, including transport to Des Moines, IA (days 1-37 PC). Across control (non-treated) ingredients, viable PEDV was detected in soybean meal (organic and conventional), Vitamin D, lysine hydrochloride and choline chloride. In contrast, viable PEDV was not detected in any samples treated with LA or MCFA. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the ability of PEDV to survive in a subset of feed ingredients using a model simulating shipment from China to the US. This is proof of concept suggesting that contaminated feed ingredients could serve as transboundary risk factors for PEDV, along with the identification of effective mitigation options.","meta":{"paper_id":"430903f42d10ae8f5729df9a61e75e2d6dc09f65","title":"Modeling the transboundary risk of feed ingredients contaminated with porcine epidemic diarrhea virus"}}
{"text":"Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole\/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro. In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans. RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice. In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity. Results of this study suggest that \u03b8-defensins represent a new class of host-directed compounds for treatment of disseminated candidiasis. Systemic infection caused by MDR fungi is a growing global health concern. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million cases of disseminated mycoses occur annually and are associated with high mortality rates 1-3 . Fungal pathogens are a major cause of hospital-acquired infection 4 , particularly among surgical patients and those with indwelling catheters 5 . Increased risk of systemic fungal infection is also associated with biologic therapies for treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases 6,7 . Among fungal infections, Candida spp. are the most frequent causative organisms worldwide 4,8 . Over 400,000 cases of candidiasis occur annually 9 with increased risk of infection associated with defects in innate immunity, neutropenia, and diabetes 10-12 . The growing incidence of MDR Candida spp. infections has contributed to the increase in mortality rates associated with systemic candidiasis 13-15 . A major risk factor for systemic candidiasis is the presence of biofilms that commonly colonize implanted medical devices such as venous catheters. Biofilms are notoriously resistant to antifungal therapy and are the source of blood borne dissemination [16] [17] [18] [19] . The failure to develop agents that are selective against eukaryotic pathogens has impeded the clinical introduction of new antifungals 14 . Currently, there are but three classes of antifungal drugs that are relied upon for treatment of invasive fungal infections: polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins 20 . Echinocandins, introduced nearly 20 years ago, are the most recently approved class of antifungals. Limitations associated with use of currently available agents include limited activity spectra 17,21,22 , serious adverse side effects 23,24 , and lack of activity against biofilms 25, 26 . The emergence of MDR fungal pathogens underscores the urgent need for development of new approaches for treatment of fungal infections [27] [28] [29] . \u03b8-defensins are macrocyclic peptides containing an 18 amino acid cyclic backbone stabilized by a tri-disulfide core 30 . Numerous naturally occurring \u03b8-defensin isoforms are expressed in Old World monkeys (OWM) such as macaques, baboons, and vervets 31-34 , but the peptides are absent in New World monkeys, apes and humans 30 . RTD-1, the prototype rhesus macaque \u03b8-defensin, is effective in preclinical models of polymicrobial and E. coli sepsis 35 , SARS-coronavirus infection 36 , a mouse model of P. aeruginosa induced cystic fibrosis 37 , and endotoxin-induced lung injury 38 . In a recent study we reported that \u03b8-defensins are potently fungicidal in vitro against MDR C. albicans and non-albicans Candida spp., including the emerging pathogen Candida auris 39 . In the current study we evaluated the antifungal activities of RTD-1 against planktonic cells and biofilms of drug sensitive and MDR C. albicans strains in vitro, and found the peptide to be fungicidal against both forms of each strain. We then tested RTD-1 for efficacy in a therapeutic mouse model of systemic candidiasis and analyzed the effects of peptide treatment on survival, fungal clearance, and on inflammatory biomarkers in infections mediated by drug-sensitive and MDR isolates of C. albicans.

{"text":"Background: Controlling the pandemic spread of newly emerging diseases requires rapid, targeted allocation of limited resources among nations. Critical, early control steps would be greatly enhanced if the key risk factors can be identified that accurately predict early disease spread immediately after emergence. Methodology\/Principal Findings: Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A\/H1N1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A\/H1N1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, as well as other socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in live swine and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which may have contributed to the emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H1N1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. Conclusions\/Significance: We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen will reach and to countries where lower healthcare resources will likely cause delays in reporting. Our results highlight the benefits, for all parties, when higher income countries provide additional healthcare resources for lower income countries, particularly those that have high air traffic volumes. In particular, international authorities should prioritize aid to those poorest countries where both the risk of emerging infectious diseases and air traffic volume is highest. This strategy will result in earlier detection of pathogens and a reduction in the impact of future pandemics.","meta":{"paper_id":"22f1e46f69ea11771ee26f499b234bd3ff1bb88b","title":"Predictive Power of Air Travel and Socio-Economic Data for Early Pandemic Spread"}}
{"text":"Respiratory diseases are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in many tropical countries, including Lao PDR. However, little has been published regarding viral or bacterial pathogens that can contribute to influenza-like illness (ILI) in a community setting. We report on the results of a community-based surveillance that prospectively monitored the incidence of ILI and its causative pathogens in Vientiane capital in Lao PDR. A cohort of 995 households, including 4885 study participants, were followed-up between May 2015 and May 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, and sputum specimens were collected from ILI cases identified through active case-finding. Real-Time PCR was used to test nasopharyngeal swabs for 21 respiratory pathogens, while throat and sputum samples were subjected to bacterial culture. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess potential risk factors for associations with ILI. In total, 548 episodes of ILI were reported among 476 (9.7%) of the study participants and 330 (33.2%) of the study households. The adjusted estimated incidence of ILI within the study area was 10.7 (95%CI: 9.4-11.9) episodes per 100 personyears. ILI was significantly associated with age group (p<0.001), sex (p<0.001), and number of bedrooms (p = 0.04) in multivariate analysis. In 548 nasopharyngeal swabs, the most commonly detected potential pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.3%), influenza A (11.1%; mostly subtype H3N2), rhinovirus (7.5%), and influenza B (8.0%). Streptococci were isolated from 42 (8.6%) of 536 throat swabs, most (27) of which were Lancefield Group G. Co-infections were observed in 132 (24.1%) of the 548 ILI episodes.

{"text":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is one of the major threats to the healthcare systems in some countries, especially in the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoV is considered an ideal example of the One Health concept. This is due to the animals, especially dromedary camels, play important roles in the transmission and sustainability of the virus, and the virus can be transmitted through aerosols of infected patients into the environment. However, there is some debate regarding the origin of MERS-CoV either from bats or other unknown reservoirs. The dromedary camel is the only identified animal reservoir to date. These animals play important roles in sustaining the virus in certain communities and may act as an amplifier of the virus by secreting it in their body fluids, especially in nasal and rectal discharges. MERS-CoV has been detected in the nasal and rectal secretions of infected camels, and MERS-CoV of this origin has full capacity to infect human airway epithelium in both in vitro and in vivo models. Other evidence confirms the direct transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans, though the role of camel meat and milk products has yet to be well studied. Human-to-human transmission is well documented through contact with an active infected patient or some silently infected persons. Furthermore, there are some significant risk factors of individuals in close contact with a positive MERS-CoV patient, including sleeping in the same patient room, removing patient waste (urine, stool, and sputum), and touching respiratory secretions from the index case. Outbreaks within family clusters have been reported, whereby some blood relative patients were infected through their wives in the same house were not infected. Some predisposing genetic factors favor MERS-CoV infection in some patients, which is worth investigating in the near future. The presence of other comorbidities may be another factor. Overall, there are many unknown\/confirmed aspects of the virus\/human\/animal network. Here, the most recent advances in this context are discussed, and the possible reasons behind the emergence and sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions are presented. Identification of the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans and searching for new reservoir\/s are of high priority. This will reduce the shedding of the virus into the environment, and thus the risk of human infection can be mitigated.","meta":{"paper_id":"58bb89f7722922bd9a47cd49e172c498d5cd73cf","title":"Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus and the One Health concept"}}
{"text":"The 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic highlighted the need for improved scientific knowledge to support better pandemic preparedness and seasonal influenza control. The Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) project, a 5-year (2012-2016) multiagency and multidisciplinary collaboration, aimed to measure disease burden, epidemiology, aetiology, risk factors, immunology, effectiveness of vaccination and other prevention strategies for influenza and other respiratory infectious diseases of public health importance. Two active, prospective, population-based surveillance systems were established for monitoring influenza and other respiratory pathogens among those hospitalized patients with acute respiratory illness and those enrolled patients seeking consultations at sentinel general practices. In 2015, a sero-epidemiological study will use a sample of patients from the same practices. These data will provide a full picture of the disease burden and risk factors from asymptomatic infections to severe hospitalized disease and deaths and related economic burden. The results during the first 2 years (2012-2013) provided scientific evidence to (a) support a change to NZ's vaccination policy for young children due to high influenza hospitalizations in these children; (b) contribute to the revision of the World Health Organization's case definition for severe acute respiratory illness for global influenza surveillance; and (c) contribute in part to vaccine strain selection using vaccine effectiveness assessment in the prevention of influenza-related consultations and hospitalizations. In summary, SHIVERS provides valuable international platforms for supporting seasonal influenza control and pandemic preparedness, and responding to other emerging\/endemic respiratory-related infections.","meta":{"paper_id":"5d76f48664d2e90c67768d51a2efda3e12c316ce","title":"Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance"}}
{"text":"In 2009, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) was identified as a novel member of the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family in China. The detailed clinical features of cases with SFTSV infection have not been well described, and the risk factors for severity among patients and fatality among severe patients remain to be determined. Clinical and laboratory features of 115 hospitalized patients with SFTSV infection during the period from June 2010 to December 2011 in Northeast China were retrospectively reviewed. We assessed the risk factors associated with severity in confirmed cases and fatality in severe cases by multivariate analysis. One hundred and three (89.6%) of 115 patients presented with multiple organ dysfunction, and 22 (19.1%) of 115 proceeded to the stage of life threatening multiple organ failure. Of the 115 patients, 14 fatalities (12.2%) were reported. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the independent predictors of risk for severity were: albumin \u226430 g\/l (OR, 8.09; 95% CI, 2.58-25.32), APTT \u2265 66 seconds (OR, 14.28; 95% CI, 3.28-62.24), sodium \u2264130 mmol\/l (OR, 5.44; 95% CI, 1.38-21.40), and presence of neurological manifestations (OR, 7.70; 95% CI, 1.91-31.12).

{"text":"Background: Pneumonia is a serious public health issue and is concerned around the world. This study is to investigate the association between viral load in children with human adenovirus (HAdV) pneumonia and disease severity. Methods: A total of 1313 cases of children hospitalized in Hunan Provincial People's Hospital due to community acquired pneumonia (CAP) from April 2011 to May 2014 were enrolled in this study. Samples of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected for the cohort. WHO criteria for CAP grading was emerged for pneumonia severity classification. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect 12 kinds of respiratory viruses. HAdV types were identified by nested PCR. The relationship between HAdV load and severity of disease was there by analyzed. Results: Finally, 174 cases (174\/1313, 13.3%) were positive for HAdV, and HAdV type 7 (HAdV-7) was the main serotype (76\/174, 43.7%). Among the 174 cases, 70 cases were with HAdV infection alone and 104 cases were accompanied by other viruses. The patients were divided into mild pneumonia group (n = 108 cases) and severe pneumonia group (n = 66 cases). HAdV load of children in severe pneumonia group was higher than that in mild pneumonia group. Similar result was obtained in the 70 cases with HAdV infection alone after subgrouping. Relevant factors analysis results showed that severe pneumonia children presented lower onset age, more prone to fever, longer fever time, and longer hospital stay compared with that of mild pneumonia children. Children with HAdV-7 infection developed more frequently severe pneumonia. Multivariate regression analysis showed that HAdV load, age, and fever time were risk factors for pneumonia severity. Conclusion: The severity of HAdV infection is significantly correlated with viral load and serotype.","meta":{"paper_id":"5f1066c0868ef0e9c5325de77d1ebbf40d6208ba","title":"Human adenovirus load in respiratory tract secretions are predictors for disease severity in children with human adenovirus pneumonia"}}

{"text":"Background: Considered an epicenter of pandemic influenza virus generation, southern China has recently seen an increasing number of human H7N9 infections. However, it is not the only threat. On 30 November 2013, a human H10N8 infection case was first described in China. The origin and genetic diversity of this novel virus is similar to that of H7N9 virus. As H10N8 avian influenza virus (AIV) was first identified from a duck in Guangdong Province during 2012 and there is also evidence of H10N8 infected dogs in this region, we sought to examine archived sera from animal workers to see if there was evidence of subclinical human infections before the first human H10N8 cases. Methods: We studied archived serum samples (cross-sectional study, convenience sample) collected between May and September 2013 from 710 animal workers and 107 non-animal exposed volunteers living in five cities of Guangdong Province. Study participants' sera were tested by horse red blood cells (RBCs) hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and microneutralization (MN) assays according to World Health Organization guidelines. The A\/Jiangxi-Donghu\/346-1\/2013 (H10N8) virus was used. Sera which have an HI assay \u22651:20 were further tested with the MN assay. Questionnaire data were examined for risk factor associations with positive serological assays. Risk factor analyses failed to identify specific factors associated with probable H10N8 infections. Results: Among the 827 sera, only 21 animal workers had an HI titer \u22651:20 (18 had an HI titer of 1:20 and 3 had an HI titer of 1:40). None of these 21 subjects reported experiencing any influenza symptoms during the three months before enrollment. Among the three subjects with HI titers of 1:40, two had MN antibody titers of 1:40, and one had a MN antibody titer of 1:80 (probable H10N8 infections). Conclusions: Study data suggest that animal workers may have been infected with the H10N8 virus before the first recognized H10N8 human infection cases. It seems prudent to continue surveillance for H10N8 viruses among animal workers.","meta":{"paper_id":"e0f36613dbfcdb38aee79337d0a011c8760acba0","title":""}}
{"text":"ARTICLE InfO Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the individual change of International prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS) in each patient by temperature conditions. Materials and Methods: The severity of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) was explored using the IPSS and OABSS questionnaires that were completed by 2.486 subjects (923 males and 1.563 females) aged 60 years and older. Korea Meteorological Administration data was used to determine daily average temperature and daily temperature difference on the interview dates at each site. Results: The mean IPSS and mean age for males was 13.45\u00b18.24 and 75.03\u00b16.20 years, respectively. The mean OABSS and mean age for females was 4.41\u00b13.10 and 73.74\u00b16.03years, respectively. Daily average temperature and daily temperature difference ranged from-3.4-28.3 o C and 2.2-16.9 o C, respectively. Age was a significantly risk factor for IPSS, OABSS, and QoL (P<0.001, <0.001, and 0.005, respectively). After multiple regression analysis, daily average temperatures did not show a statistically significant change in IPSS and OABSS. Only daily temperature differences were associated with male LUTS. Conclusions: While LUTS could be worsened in low temperatures generally, IPSS and OABSS were not affected by daily average temperature conditions. Daily temperature differences may be more influential than daily average temperatures.","meta":{"paper_id":"87154b31b741f39ec7e34f3590f80b9a01105e33","title":"Association between ambient temperature and lower urinary tract symptoms: a community-based survey"}}

{"text":"Background: Infectious diarrhea is a common problem in the developing world, especially among people living with HIV\/AIDS. Traditional diagnostic methods such as stool culture and microscopic examination are limited by resources and poor sensitivity. The use of molecular diagnostics for enteropathogen detection in this region of sub-Saharan Africa has not been fully explored. We sought to identify risk factors and characterize enteropathogens from diarrheic stools of HIV-positive patients in Gondar, Ethiopia using multiplex molecular panels targeting key infectious agents. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 100 stool samples was performed. Samples were collected consecutively from HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea at University of Gondar Hospital clinic, a major center in NW Ethiopia. Genomic DNA was extracted from stool and processed using a multiplex molecular panel Allplex\u2122 [Seegene, Canada]. Correlations between patient characteristics, symptoms, public health risk factors, and enteropathogen type (s) were studied. Eighty-six samples were successfully analyzed by molecular methods. Results: The mean age was 35 with 43% male. Eighty percent lived in an urban area, 18% had access to well water only, and 81% practiced proper hand hygiene. The majority of patients (72%) were receiving HAART with a median CD4 cell count of 362\/\u03bcL. Multiple pathogens were detected in 94% of specimens, with an average of 5 enteropathogens per sample. Common bacteria, viruses, and parasites detected were Shigella spp.\/enteroinvasive E. coli (80%), enterotoxigenic E. coli (73%), Norovirus (16%) and B. hominis (62%).

Objectives: To describe the current etiology of CAP in Malawi and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of adults hospitalized with CAP to a teaching hospital in Blantyre, Malawi. Etiology was defined by blood culture, Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen detection, sputum mycobacterial culture and Xpert MTB\/RIF, and nasopharyngeal aspirate multiplex PCR. Measurements and Main Results: In 459 patients (285 [62.1%] males; median age, 34.7 [interquartile range, 29.4-41.9] yr), 30-day mortality was 14.6% (64\/439) and associated with male sex (adjusted odds ratio, 2.60 [95% confidence interval, 1.17-5.78]), symptom duration greater than 7 days (2.78 [1.40-5.54]), tachycardia (2.99 [1.48-6.06]), hypoxemia (4.40 [2.03-9.51]), and inability to stand (3.59 [1.72-7.50]).

The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. Methods-GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. Findings-The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17\u00b72% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186\u00b77 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26\u00b79% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83\u00b73% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight This is an Open Access article under the CC BY license. and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60-80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3\u00b77% to 7\u00b75% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from noncommunicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. Interpretation-Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the conflicts.","meta":{"paper_id":"b6f1dc149af87fc1daff699b8b599dae61773ebd","title":"Lancet Glob Health"}}

This study was initiated due to the lack of published data concerning the real progress in research output in the use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for tobacco cessation. This study was aimed to use bibliometric analysis to estimate the NRT literature indexed in Scopus database at global level. Methods: Core of the search strategy was the documents that contained specific words or phrases regarding NRT as keywords in the title. Publication output of most prolific countries was adjusted to the gross domestic product and population size. All citations analysis were accomplished on December 22, 2017. Results: A total of 2138 references were retrieved and published from 56 countries, which were published between 1970 and 2016. The USA has the most number of published articles accounted to 986, followed by the UK (312 publications) and then Australia (102 publications), and Sweden (102 publications). No data related to NRT were published from 156 countries. No significant correlation was found between the country population size or 2016 gross domestic product values and the number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = \u2212 0.156, P = 0.664; and r = \u2212 0.173, P = 0.632, respectively). Furthermore, there is no correlation between prevalence of tobacco smoking and number of publications of the top-10 most prolific countries in the field of NRT (r = \u2212 0.235, P = 0.514). Conclusions: The present data reveal a solid mass of research activity on NRT. The USA was by far the predominant country in the amount of NRT-based research activity.

{"text":"Following the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and ongoing sporadic avian-to-human transmission of H5N1 viruses, an emphasis has been placed on better understanding the determinants and pathogenesis of severe influenza infections. Much of the current literature has focused on viral genetics and its impact on host immunity as well as novel risk factors for severe infection (particularly within the H1N1 pandemic). An understanding of the host genetic determinants of susceptibility and severe respiratory illness, however, is currently lacking. By better defining the role of genetic variability in influenza infection and identifying key polymorphisms that impair the host immune response or correlate with protection, we will be able to better identify at-risk populations and new targets for therapeutic interventions and vaccines. This paper will summarize known immunogenetic factors associated with susceptibility or severity of both pH1N1 and H5N1 infections and will also identify genetic pathways and polymorphisms of high relevance for future study.","meta":{"paper_id":"379dc32e1a173ffb789b66c9dccea4219ace8fde","title":"Immunogenetic Factors Associated with Severe Respiratory Illness Caused by Zoonotic H1N1 and H5N1 Influenza Viruses"}}
{"text":"Etiology of community acquired pneumonia among children in India: prospective, cohort study Background Childhood community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a significant problem in developing countries, and confirmation of microbial etiology is important for individual, as well as public health. However, there is paucity of data from a large cohort, examining multiple biological specimens for diverse pathogens (bacteria and viruses). The Community Acquired Pneumonia Etiology Study (CAPES) was designed to address this knowledge gap. We enrolled children with CAP (based on WHO IMCI criteria of tachypnea with cough or breathing difficulty) over 24 consecutive months, and recorded presenting symptoms, risk factors, clinical signs, and chest radiography. We performed blood and nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) bacterial cultures, and serology (Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae). We also performed multiplex PCR for 25 bacterial\/viral species in a subgroup representing 20% of the cohort. Children requiring endotracheal intubation underwent culture and PCR of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens. We enrolled 2345 children. NPA and blood cultures yielded bacteria in only 322 (13.7%) and 49 (2.1%) children, respectively. In NPA, Streptococcus pneumoniae (79.1%) predominated, followed by Haemophilus influenzae (9.6%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.8%). In blood, S. aureus (30.6%) dominated, followed by S. pneumoniae (20.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.2%). M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae serology were positive in 4.3% and 1.1% respectively.

{"text":"Background: A limitation of both culture-based and molecular methods of screening for staphylococcal infection is that current tests determine only the presence or absence of colonization with no information on the colonizing strain type. A technique that couples polymerase chain reaction to mass spectrometry (PCR\/ESI-MS) has recently been developed and an assay validated to identify and genotype S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Methods: This study was conducted to determine the rates, risk factors, and molecular genotypes of colonizing Staphylococcus aureus in adult patients presenting to an inner-city academic emergency department. Participants completed a structured questionnaire to assess hospital and community risks for infection with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Nasal swabs were analyzed by PCR\/ESI-MS to identify and genotype S. aureus and CoNS. Results: Of 200 patients evaluated, 59 were colonized with S. aureus; 27 of these were methicillin-resistant strains. Twenty-four of the 59 S. aureus carriers were co-colonized with a CoNS and 140 of the 200 patients were colonized exclusively with CoNS. The molecular genotypes of the 59 S. aureus strains were diverse; 21 unique molecular genotypes belonging to seven major clonal complexes were identified. Eighty-five of 200 patients carried strains with high-level mupirocin resistance. Of these eighty-five participants, 4 were colonized exclusively with S. aureus, 16 were co-colonized with S. aureus and CoNS, and 65 were colonized exclusively with CoNS. Conclusion: The prevalence of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus colonization in a random sample of patients seeking care in Emergency Department was 29.5% and 13.5%, respectively. A substantial fraction of the S. aureus-colonized patients were co-colonized with CoNS and high-level mupirocin-resistant CoNS. Determining the molecular genotype of S. aureus during intake screening may prove valuable in the future if certain molecular genotypes become associated with increased infection risk.","meta":{"paper_id":"fd28c322b33337c09ccb3d0785d8c2494efa0946","title":"Rapid PCR\/ESI-MS-based molecular genotyping of Staphylococcus aureus from nasal swabs of emergency department patients"}}
{"text":"Purpose To determine causes of variability in communicable disease prevalence rates among students in secondary schools to inform policy formulation in the public health sector. Methods A representative cluster sample size for students was estimated using Fisher et al.'s formula while schools, sub-counties and education zones were clustered and sample size was calculated based on coefficient of variation by school type. Data were collected by questionnaire, medical examination using standard procedures, and focus group discussion, and descriptive analysis was performed on the completed questions. Comparisons between risk factors were made by chi-square and ANOVA analysis using SPSS for Windows (version 15.2; Chicago, IL) software. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results There was significant variation between communicable disease prevalence rates and age (X 2 4 , 0.05 = 2.458), school size (X 2 12, 0.05 = 18.636), gender (X 2 4 , 0 . 0 5 = 5.723) and class of students (X 2 1 2 , 0.05 = 15.202), and bed and desk spacing (p < 0.05 at 95% CI). However, there was no significant association in prevalence rates between both locality and type of school. There was strong evidence that student age has an effect on prevalence rates. The prevalence rate of malaria was higher in male (14.02%) than female students (6.68%) compared to prevalence of diarrhea, which was higher in female (7.96%) than male students. Conclusion This study has revealed that the prevalences of diarrhea, tuberculosis, pneumonia and other respiratory tract infections are lower among female secondary school students than males and that the prevalence of malaria is higher in males than females. Age of secondary school students is a significant vulnerability factor for malaria, diarrhea, tuberculosis and pneumonia, which were the important communicable diseases most prevalent among secondary school students in Kisumu County, Kenya.","meta":{"paper_id":"cbb02b21e4165b060929344f2f02ab6859016be3","title":"Causes of variability in prevalence rates of communicable diseases among secondary school Students in Kisumu County, Kenya"}}
{"text":"Formal, quantitative approaches are now widely used to make predictions about the likelihood of an infectious disease outbreak, how the disease will spread, and how to control it. Several wellestablished methodologies are available, including risk factor analysis, risk modelling and dynamic modelling. Even so, predictive modelling is very much the 'art of the possible', which tends to drive research effort towards some areas and away from others which may be at least as important. Building on the undoubted success of quantitative modelling of the epidemiology and control of human and animal diseases such as AIDS, influenza, foot-and-mouth disease and BSE, attention needs to be paid to developing a more holistic framework that captures the role of the underlying drivers of disease risks, from demography and behaviour to land use and climate change. At the same time, there is still considerable room for improvement in how quantitative analyses and their outputs are communicated to policy makers and other stakeholders. A starting point would be generally accepted guidelines for 'good practice' for the development and the use of predictive models.","meta":{"paper_id":"95cff929be1b2765e78d6293e4722f404a814011","title":"How to make predictions about future infectious disease risks"}}
{"text":"Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be fatal if untreated early and appropriately. Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 levels and lesion size and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1\u03b2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg\/ ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd 1 year were significantly low by an average of 18.45 pg\/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's duration of \ufffd 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a negative significant association with IL-12, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pntd.0007098 April 4, 2019 1 \/ 18 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Abushouk A, Nasr A, Masuadi E, Allam G, Siddig EE, Fahal AH (2019) The Role of Interleukin-1 cytokine family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and interleukin-12 cytokine family (IL-12, IL-35) in eumycetoma infection pathogenesis.

In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 in eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact on disease progression. Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community. Previous data suggested a crucial role of adaptive immunity in host resistance to causative agents and in the disease progress. The recently identified IL-35 and IL-37 cytokines revealed an important role in immune suppression. Nevertheless, the expression of these interleukins in patients with mycetoma has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present case-control study aimed to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The results of this study showed that, the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration. However, the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 were consistently negatively correlated with different diameters of lesions and the duration of mycetoma infection. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in patients of mycetoma revealed a negative significant association with IL-12. These findings uncover a possible the role of IL-35 and IL-37 in the pathogenesis of mycetoma, and may declare their potential value in treatment of mycetoma.

Method: We searched international (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane) and Korean databases (DBpia, KISS) for English-or Korean-language articles using the terms \"MERS\" and \"Middle East respiratory syndrome\". Only human studies with > 20 participants were analysed to exclude studies with low representation. Epidemiologic studies with information on transmissibility and severity of MERS as well as studies containing MERS risk factors were included. Result: A total of 59 studies were included. Most studies from Saudi Arabia reported higher mortality (22-69.2%) than those from South Korea (20.4%). While the R 0 value in Saudi Arabia was < 1 in all but one study, in South Korea, the R 0 value was 2.5-8.09 in the early stage and decreased to < 1 in the later stage. The incubation period was 4.5-5.2 days in Saudi Arabia and 6-7.8 days in South Korea. Duration from onset was 4-10 days to confirmation, 2.9-5.3 days to hospitalization, 11-17 days to death, and 14-20 days to discharge. Older age and concomitant disease were the most common factors related to MERS infection, severity, and mortality.

{"text":"Background: From October 2010 through February 2016, Arizona conducted surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) among adults hospitalized in the Arizona-Mexico border region. There are few accurate mortality estimates in SARI patients, particularly in adults \u2265 65 years old. The purpose of this study was to generate mortality estimates among SARI patients that include deaths occurring shortly after hospital discharge and identify risk factors for mortality. Methods: Patients admitted to two sentinel hospitals between 2010 and 2014 who met the SARI case definition were enrolled. Demographic data were used to link SARI patients to Arizona death certificates. Mortality within 30 days after the date of admission was calculated and risk factors were identified using logistic regression models. Results: Among 258 SARI patients, 47% were females, 51% were white, non-Hispanic and 39% were Hispanic. The median age was 63 years (range, 19 to 97 years) and 80% had one or more pre-existing health condition; 9% died in hospital.

{"text":"Background: Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is characterized by interstitial infiltration of T lymphocytes, and subpopulations of these cells may be associated with the progression of fibrosis. However, few studies evaluate the correlation of prognosis with this characteristic. Therefore, we performed morphological and quantitative analyses of T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP and evaluated the relationship between T lymphocytes and prognosis. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 55 biopsies of patients with NSIP to determine the numbers of these T cell subpopulations in lymphoid follicles as well as in perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchial anatomical compartments. The relationship between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. Results: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 \u00b1 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 \u00b1 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up.

The prevalence of sepsis is higher in male infants than in females, but the exact cause is unknown. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which leads to the production of NADPH. NADPH is required for the respiratory burst reaction in white blood cells (WBCs) to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis. Materials and methods. This study was performed on 76 neonates with sepsis and 1214 normal neonates from February 2012 to November 2014 in the west of Iran. The G6PD deficiency status was determined by fluorescent spot test. WBCs number and neutrophils percentages were measured and compared in patients with and without G6PD deficiency. Results. The prevalence of the G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis was significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.03).

This study aimed to determine which preventive measures may have been effective in protecting HCWs from infection, and which were not effective. Methods: A retrospective study was performed among 758 'frontline' health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the \"case group\" and the \"control group\", and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs. After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which an individual worked, the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that incidence of SARS among HCWs was significantly and positively associated with: performing tracheal intubations for SARS patients, methods used for air ventilation in wards, avoiding face-to-face interaction with SARS patients, the number of pairs of gloves worn by HCWs, and caring for serious SARS cases.

In this review we examine whether healthcare facility design is a contributing factor to multifaceted infection control strategies. Methods: We searched PubMed\/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from 1990 to December 31 st , 2015, with language restriction to English, Spanish, German and French. Results: We identified three studies investigating accessibility of the location of the antiseptic hand rub dispenser. Each of them showed a significant improvement of hand hygiene compliance or agent consumption with the implementation of accessible dispensers near the patient bed. Nine eligible studies evaluated the impact of single-patient rooms on the acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infections in comparison to multi-bedrooms or an open ward design. Six of these studies showed a significant benefit of single-patient bedrooms in reducing the healthcare-associated colonization and infection rate, whereas three studies found that single-patient rooms are neither a protective nor risk factor. In meta-analyses, the overall risk ratio for acquisition of healthcare-associated colonization and infection was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.74), for healthcare-associated colonization 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32 to 0.85) and for bacteremia 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.76), all in favor of patient care in single-patient bedrooms.

{"text":"Background: In March of 2003, an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in Northern Vietnam. This outbreak began when a traveler arriving from Hong Kong sought medical care at a small hospital (Hospital A) in Hanoi, initiating a serious and substantial transmission event within the hospital, and subsequent limited spread within the community. We surveyed Hospital A personnel for exposure to the index patient and for symptoms of disease during the outbreak. Additionally, serum specimens were collected and assayed for antibody to SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) antibody and job-specific attack rates were calculated. A nested case-control analysis was performed to assess risk factors for acquiring SARS-CoV infection. One hundred and fifty-three of 193 (79.3%) clinical and non-clinical staff consented to participate. Excluding job categories with <3 workers, the highest SARS attack rates occurred among nurses who worked in the outpatient and inpatient general wards (57.1, 47.4%, respectively). Nurses assigned to the operating room\/intensive care unit, experienced the lowest attack rates (7.1%) among all clinical staff. Serologic evidence of SARS-CoV infection was detected in 4 individuals, including 2 non-clinical workers, who had not previously been identified as SARS cases; none reported having had fever or cough. Entering the index patient's room and having seen (viewed) the patient were the behaviors associated with highest risk for infection by univariate analysis (odds ratios 20.0, 14.0; 95% confidence intervals 4.1-97.1, 3.6-55.3, respectively). This study highlights job categories and activities associated with increased risk for SARS-CoV infection and demonstrates that a broad diversity of hospital workers may be vulnerable during an outbreak.

A final multivariable model identified three risk factors for H9 infection in LRBS, namely obtaining birds from mixed sources (OR 2.28, CI 95% : 1.4-3.7), keeping birds outside cages (OR 3.10, CI 95% : 1.4-7.0) and keeping chicken breeds other than broilers (OR 6.27, CI 95% : 1. Live bird markets (LBM) are an important component of traditional poultry marketing systems in many developing countries. The characteristics of LBM have not been particularly well studied, but are known to vary from region to region depending upon the needs of the local customers 1,2 . These LBM, also known as 'wet markets' have been recognized as important for the maintenance and viral re-assortment of avian influenza viruses (AIV) 3-5 . The risks associated with these markets are exacerbated, where large numbers of poultry are maintained with poor biosecurity, as in many Asian countries 6 . Wet markets are thought to be a missing link in the epidemiology of AIV and due to the low-level biosecurity measures, these markets can provide a promising environment for perpetuation of AIV among various species, including humans 7,8 .","meta":{"paper_id":"db4c8228189750c2de16f125ea1a96feefd63bda","title":"Risk Factors for Avian Influenza H9 Infection of Chickens in Live Bird Retail Stalls of Lahore District, OPEN"}}
{"text":"Background: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality, especially among non-affluent communities. In this study we determine the impact of respiratory viruses and how viral co-detections\/infections can affect clinical LRTI severity in children in a hospital setting. Methods: Patients younger than 3 years of age admitted to a tertiary hospital in Brazil during the months of high prevalence of respiratory viruses had samples collected from nasopharyngeal aspiration. These samples were tested for 13 different respiratory viruses through real-time PCR (rt-PCR). Patients were followed during hospitalization, and clinical data and population characteristics were collected during that period and at discharge to evaluate severity markers, especially length of hospital stay and oxygen use. Univariate regression analyses identified potential risk factors and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the impact of specific viral detections as well as viral co-detections in relation to clinical outcomes. We analyzed 260 episodes of LRTI with a viral detection rate of 85% (n = 222). Co-detection was observed in 65% of all virus-positive episodes. The most prevalent virus was Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (54%), followed by Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) (32%) and Human Rhinovirus (HRV) (21%). In the multivariate models, infants with co-detection of HRV + RSV stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004), when compared to infants without the codetection. The same trends were observed for the outcome of days of supplemental oxygen use. Conclusions: Although RSV remains as the main cause of LRTI in infants our study indicates an increase in the length of hospital stay and oxygen use in infants with HRV detected by RT-PCR compared to those without HRV. Moreover, one can speculate that when HRV is detected simultaneously with RSV there is an additive effect that may be reflected in more severe clinical outcome. Also, our study identified a significant number of children infected by recently identified viruses, such as hMPV and Human Bocavirus (HBov), and this is a novel finding for poor communities from developing countries.","meta":{"paper_id":"1b8bd44173742cd254617aabc5fdf20fb98f4072","title":"Severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and toddlers from a non-affluent population: viral etiology and co-detection as risk factors"}}
{"text":"Background: Hemotropic mycoplasmas (hemoplasmas) have been found infecting cats worldwide. However, studies about feline hemoplasma infections in Spain are scarce. Therefore, the purpose of the research was to evaluate the prevalence of feline hemotropic mycoplasmas and to characterize risk factors and clinical findings associated with these infections in a cat population from the Madrid area, Spain. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\" (CMhm) and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\" (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. Results: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22\/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48\/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3\/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and \"Candidatus M. turicensis\" and another one (0. 17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus \"M. turicensis\". Male gender, collection of blood during warm months and FeLV\/FIV positivity status were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. Additionally, within the group of client-owned cats, hemoplasma infection was associated with adult age, outdoor access, and the existence of low haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration values. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas performed in central Spain (Madrid). Our study confirms that \"Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum\", Mycoplasma haemofelis and \"Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis\" are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, \"Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum\" being the most prevalent species.

The aim of the study was to test whether obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg\/m 2 ) is one of the risk factors underlying frequent RTIs in the German adult population. Methods: We recruited 1455 individuals between 18 to 70 years from a cross-sectional survey on airway infections in Germany and invited them to self-report in diaries incident RTIs experienced during three consecutive winter\/ spring seasons. RTIs reported in these 18 months and summary measures adding-up individual RTIs were the outcomes of interest. Results: Compared to individuals with normal weight, obese individuals reported a consistently higher frequency of upper and lower RTIs and predominantly fell in the upper 10% group of a diary sumscore adding-up 10 different RTI symptoms over time. Obesity was associated both with lower RTIs ( adjusted OR = 2.02, 95%CI = 1.36-3.00) and upper RTIs ( adjusted OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.22-1.96). Adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables did only marginally affect ORs. Stratified analyses suggested a stronger association for women and effect modifications by sports activity and dietary habits.

{"text":"Background: Hospitals are often the epicentres of newly circulating infections. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of acquiring infectious diseases and may be among the first to contract emerging infections. This study aims to explore European HCWs' perceptions and attitudes towards monitoring their absence and symptom reports for surveillance of newly circulating infections. Methods: A qualitative study with thematic analysis was conducted using focus group methodology. Forty-nine hospital-based HCWs from 12 hospitals were recruited to six focus groups; two each in England and Hungary and one each in Germany and Greece. Results: HCWs perceived risk factors for occupationally acquired infectious diseases to be 1.) exposure to patients with undiagnosed infections 2.) break-down in infection control procedures 3.) immuno-na\u00efvety and 4.) symptomatic colleagues. They were concerned that a lack of monitoring and guidelines for infectious HCWs posed a risk to staff and patients and felt employers failed to take a positive interest in their health. Staffing demands and loss of income were noted as pressures to attend work when unwell. In the UK, Hungary and Greece participants felt monitoring staff absence and the routine disclosure of symptoms could be appropriate provided the effectiveness and efficiency of such a system were demonstrable. In Germany, legislation, privacy and confidentiality were identified as barriers. All HCWs highlighted the need for knowledge and structural improvements for timelier recognition of emerging infections. These included increased suspicion and awareness among staff and standardised, homogenous absence reporting systems. Conclusions: Monitoring absence and infectious disease symptom reports among HCWs may be a feasible means of surveillance for emerging infections in some settings. A pre-requisite will be tackling the drivers for symptomatic HCWs to attend work.","meta":{"paper_id":"cc5bd8ae2cac9621202c04c1ec25699f5b7c3a91","title":"Preventing the next 'SARS' -European healthcare workers' attitudes towards monitoring their health for the surveillance of newly emerging infections: qualitative study"}}
{"text":"Background: Nebulised medical aerosols are designed to deliver drugs to the lungs to aid in the treatment of respiratory diseases. However, an unintended consequence is the potential for fugitive emissions during patient treatment, which may pose a risk factor in both clinical and homecare settings. Methods: The current study examined the potential for fugitive emissions, using albuterol sulphate as a tracer aerosol during high-flow therapy. A nasal cannula was connected to a head model or alternatively, a interface was connected to a tracheostomy tube in combination with a simulated adult and paediatric breathing profile. Two aerodynamic particle sizers (APS) recorded time-series aerosol concentrations and size distributions at two different distances relative to the simulated patient. Results: The results showed that the quantity and characteristics of the fugitive emissions were influenced by the interface type, patient type and supplemental gas-flow rate. There was a trend in the adult scenarios; as the flow rate increased, the fugitive emissions and the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of the aerosol both decreased. The fugitive emissions were comparable when using the adult breathing profiles for the nasal cannula and tracheostomy interfaces; however, there was a noticeable distinction between the two interfaces when compared for the paediatric breathing profiles. The highest recorded aerosol concentration was 0.370 \u00b1 0.046 mg m \u22123 from the tracheostomy interface during simulated paediatric breathing with a gas-flow rate of 20 L\/min. The averaged MMAD across all combinations ranged from 1.248 to 1.793 \u00b5m by the APS at a distance of 0.8 m away from the patient interface. Conclusions: Overall, the results highlight the potential for secondary inhalation of fugitive emissions released during simulated aerosol treatment with concurrent high-flow therapy. The findings will help in developing policy and best practice for risk mitigation from fugitive emissions.","meta":{"paper_id":"2269f102137c683d0a7871a9ea5110298bd3598c","title":"pharmaceutics Investigation of Fugitive Aerosols Released into the Environment during High-Flow Therapy"}}
{"text":"The sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) encoded by SLC10A1 was recently demonstrated to be a functional receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The role of SLC10A1 polymorphisms, particularly the Ser267Phe variant (rs2296651) in exon 4, has been frequently investigated in regard to risk of persistent HBV infection. However, these investigations have generated conflicting results. To examine whether common genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is associated with risk of persistent HBV infection, haplotype-tagging and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in two case-control sample sets, totally including 2,550 cases (persistently HBV infected subjects, PIs) and 2,124 controls (spontaneously recovered subjects, SRs) of Southern Chinese ancestry. To test whether rare or subpolymorphic SLC10A1 variants are associated with disease risk, the gene's exons in 244 cases were sequenced. Overall, we found neither SNPs nor haplotypes of SLC10A1 showed significant association in the two sample sets. Furthermore, no significant associations of rare variants or copy number variation covering SLC10A1 were observed. Finally, expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that SNPs potentially affecting SLC10A1 expression also showed no significant associations. We conclude that genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is not likely a major risk factor of persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese.

The aim of this study is to determine the current knowledge, attitude and behaviour of hand and food hygiene, and the potential risk factors of diarrhoea in a residential community of Singapore. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted within a residential area in the west of Singapore from June to August 2013. A total of 1,156 household units were randomly sampled and invited to participate in an interviewer-assisted survey using standardised questionnaires. Descriptive, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's Exact test and multivariate logistic regression modelling, respectively. R program was used for all statistical analysis. All tests were conducted at 5 % level of significance with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) reported where applicable. Results: A total of 240 units (20.8 %) consented and responded to the survey invitation. About 77 % of the expected knowledge and attitude were observed in at least 80 % of the participants, compared to only about 31 % of the expected behaviours and practises. Being single [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.29; 95 % CI = 1.16-4.48], having flu in the past six month (AOR = 3.24; 95 % CI = 1.74-6.06), preferred self-medication (AOR = 2.07; 95 % CI = 1.06-4.12) were risk factors of diarrhoea. Washing hands with water before attending to children or sick persons (AOR = 0.30; 95 % CI = 0.11-0.82), washing hands with water (AOR = 0.16; 95 % CI = 0.05-0.45) and water with soap (AOR = 0.29; 95 % CI = 0.12-0.72) after attending to children or sick persons, and hand washing between 30 s to a minute (AOR = 0.44; 95 % CI = 0.20-0.90) were protective factors against diarrhoea. Conclusions: Good knowledge and attitude of the participants did not positively translate into high compliance and motivation to perform good hygiene practices. This observation may have resulted in a significant extent on the increasing diarrhoea incidences. Current interventions may be improved with more active community partnership among the residents, schools and the relevant social organizations, to raise awareness on the importance of compliance to good hygiene practices, and the risk factors of diarrhoea.

{"text":"It is unclarified as to whether viral co-detection and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) genotypes relate to clinical manifestations in children with HMPV and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), and if the clinical course and risk factors for severe LRTI differ between HMPV and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations. No clinical differences were found between HMPV genotypes A (n = 67) and B (n = 80). The HMPV-infected children were older (median 17.2 months) than RSV-infected children (median 7.3 months, n = 859). Among single virus-infected children, no differences in age-adjusted LRTI diagnoses were found between HMPV and RSV. Age was an important factor for disease severity among single virus-infected children, where children <6 months old with HMPV had a milder disease than those with RSV, while in children 12-23 months old, the pattern was the opposite. In multivariable logistic regression analysis for each virus type, age !12 months (HMPV), and age <6 months (RSV), prematurity, !1 chronic disease and high viral loads of RSV, but not high HMPV viral loads, were risk factors for severe disease. and Technology. The supporters had no role in the study design, data Among hospitalized children with LRTI, HMPV manifests independently of viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes. Disease severity in HMPV-and RSV-infected children varies in relation to age. A history of prematurity and chronic disease increases the risk of severe LRTI among HMPV-and RSV-infected children. Since the discovery of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in 2001 [1], studies from all parts of the world have shown that HMPV causes respiratory tract infection (RTI) in children [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . HMPV is usually detected in airway secretions from children with RTI by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and the virus seldom appears in healthy children [8] . HMPV has been classified into the Pneumoviridae family. Two main genotypes (A and B) and at least four genetic subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2) exist [9-12]. Whether these genotypes cause similar or different infections is largely unclarified because some studies have shown quite similar manifestations [13] [14] [15] , whereas others found that either genotypes A [16, 17] or B [18] may cause more severe disease. Using sensitive nucleic-acid based molecular tests to diagnose viral pathogens has revealed that many children with LRTI have more than one virus present in the respiratory tract [14, 19, 20] . Previous studies in HMPV-infected children found that such viral co-detections were associated with increased disease severity [21, 22] . However, this was not confirmed in other studies [14, 17, 19, 23] . HMPV is closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), by far the most important airway virus affecting children worldwide [6, 14, 20, 24] . It has been reported that RSV and HMPV infections in children may be quite similar [23, 25, 26] , but there is also some evidence that RSV causes more severe disease than HMPV [6, 18] . Risk factors for severe RSV infection are young age, prematurity, chronic lung disease, chronic heart disease and severe neurological disabilities [18, 24, [27] [28] [29] [30] . Although it has not been studied to the same extent, it seems that some of these factors may also increase the risk of severe HMPV infection [2, 17, 18, 29, [31] [32] [33] . With some exceptions [18, 29] , most studies have separately dealt with risk factors for severe HMPV and RSV infections. In the present study, we prospectively enrolled a large cohort of children <16 years old, who were admitted to hospital with acute RTI during a nearly 9-year long period from 2006 to 2015, and diagnosed a broad panel of respiratory viruses. Our primary aim was to study clinical manifestations in children with HMPV lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), taking viral co-detections and HMPV genotypes into account. Our secondary aim was to compare HMPV-and RSV-infected children with LRTI, with a special emphasis on clinical manifestations and risk factors for severe disease.","meta":{"paper_id":"4b7667a10db8449042b2fa73329cdfac5358ad34","title":"Comparing Human Metapneumovirus and Respiratory Syncytial Virus: Viral Co- Detections, Genotypes and Risk Factors for Severe Disease"}}
{"text":"Background and Aim: Rhipicephalus microplus (Rm) is one of the most problematic livestock tick species in the world. Its rapid propagation and resistance to acaricides make it control difficult in the sub-region and Benin particularly. The aim of this work was to check its presence in wildlife and to confirm the possible role of reservoir wildlife may play in the propagation of the parasite. This will help to design more efficient control strategy. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted from February to March 2017 in the National Parks of Benin (Pendjari and W Park) and wildfowl's assembly and selling point in Benin. Ticks were manually picked with forceps from each animal after slaughtering by hunters then stored in 70\u00b0 ethanol. Collected ticks were counted and identified in the laboratory using the identification key as described by Walker. Results: Overall, seven species of ticks (Amblyomma variegatum, Boophilus decoloratus, Rm, Boophilus spp., Hyalomma spp., Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Rhipicephalus spp.) were identified on nine wild animal species sampled (Cane rat, wildcat, Hare, Doe, Cricetoma, Buffalo, Buffon Cobe, and Bushbuck and Warthog). The average number of ticks varies from 3 to 6 between animal species, 3 to 7 between localities visited, and 2 to 5 between tick species. However, these differences are statistically significant only for localities. Considering tick species and animal species, the parasite load of Rm and Rhipicephalus spp. is higher; the buffalo being more infested. The analysis of deviance reveals that the abundance of ticks observed depends only on the observed localities (p>0.05). However, the interactions between animal species and localities on the one hand and between animal and tick species on the other hand, although not significant, have influenced the abundance of ticks as they reduce the residual deviance after their inclusion in the model. Conclusion: This study reported the presence of Rm in wildlife of Benin and confirmed its role in the maintenance and spread of the parasites. It is, therefore, an important risk factor that we must not neglect in the epidemiological surveillance and ticks control strategies in the West African sub-region and particularly in Benin.","meta":{"paper_id":"a04811d55a6f779546cf0c2bf5d46982fb989908","title":"Preliminary study on the tick population of Benin wildlife at the moment of its invasion by the Rhipicephalus microplus tick (Canestrini, 1888)"}}
{"text":"A balanced immune response to infection is essential to prevent the pathology and tissue damage that can occur from an unregulated or hyperactive host defense. Interferons (IFNs) are critical mediators of the innate defense to infection, and in this study we evaluated the contribution of a specific gene coding for IFIT2 induced by type I IFNs in a murine model of disseminated Candida albicans. Invasive candidiasis is a frequent challenge during immunosuppression or surgical medical interventions, and C. albicans is a common culprit that leads to high rates of mortality. When IFIT2 knockout mice were infected systemically with C. albicans, they were found to have improved survival and reduced fungal burden compared to wild-type mice. One of the mechanisms by which IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans appears to be suppression of NADPH oxidase activation. Loss of IFIT2 increases production of reactive oxygen species by leukocytes, and we demonstrate that IFIT2 is a binding partner of a critical regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidase, p67 phox . Since the administration of IFN has been used therapeutically to combat viral infections, cancer, and multiple sclerosis, we evaluated administration of IFN-\u2424 to mice prior to C. albicans infection. IFN-\u2424 treatment promoted pathology and death from C. albicans infection. We provide evidence that IFIT2 increases the pathological effects of invasive C. albicans and that administration of IFN-\u2424 has deleterious effects during infection. The attributable mortality associated with systemic C. albicans infections in health care settings is significant, with estimates greater than 40%. This lifethreatening disease is common in patients with weakened immune systems, either due to disease or as a result of therapies. Type I interferons (IFN) are cytokines of the innate defense response that are used as immune modulators in the treatment of specific cancers, viral infections, and multiple sclerosis. In this study, we show using a murine model that the loss of a specific IFN-stimulated gene coding for IFIT2 improves survival following systemic C. albicans infection. This result infers a harmful effect of IFN during C. albicans infection and is supported by our finding that administration of IFN-\u2424 prior to invasive infection promotes fatal pathology. The findings contribute to our understanding of the innate immune response to C. albicans, and they suggest that IFN therapies present a risk factor for disseminated candidiasis.

{"text":"Simple Summary: Feline upper respiratory infection is a common disease in animal shelters. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention is difficult. We looked at a software system a used in shelters across the United States to determine if it can be used to track URI frequency and risk factors in a population. Reports from the software system a were compared to data collected manually. This showed that data currently collected were not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors. However, potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases. Abstract: Objective-Feline upper respiratory infection (URI) is a common, multi-factorial infectious disease syndrome endemic to many animal shelters. Although a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in shelter cats, URI is seldom formally monitored in shelter cat populations. Without monitoring, effective control and prevention of this often endemic disease is difficult. We looked at an integrated case management software system a for animal care organizations, widely used in shelters across the United States. Shelter staff routinely enter information regarding individual animals and disease status, but do not commonly use the software system to track frequency of disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the software system a can be used to track URI frequency and selected risk factors in a population, and to evaluate the quality and completeness of the data as currently collected in a shelter. Design (type of study)-Descriptive Survey. Animals (or Sample)-317 Animals 2015, 5 162 cats in an animal shelter. Procedures-Reports from the software system a containing data regarding daily inventory, daily intake, animal identification, location, age, vaccination status, URI diagnosis and URI duration were evaluated. The reports were compared to data collected manually by an observer (Ann Therese Kommedal) to assess discrepancies, completeness, timeliness, availability and accuracy. Data were collected 6 days a week over a 4 week period. Results-Comparisons between the software system a reports and manually collected reports showed that 93% of inventory reports were complete and of these 99% were accurate. Fifty-two percent of the vaccination reports were complete, of which 97% were accurate. The accuracy of the software system's age reports was 76%. Two-hundred and twenty-three cats were assigned a positive or negative URI diagnosis by the observer. The predictive value of the URI status in the software system a was below 60% both for positive and negative URI diagnosis. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-data currently collected and entered into the software systems in the study shelter, was not useful for tracking URI frequency and risk factors, due to issues with both data quality and capture. However, the potential exists to increase the practicality and usefulness of this shelter software system to monitor URI and other diseases.

{"text":"Background: The intention of the following study was to describe the interrelationship between villagers, domestic animals and wildlife at the Community Forestry Concession of Uaxact\u00fan, Guatemala by means of participatory epidemiological methods. The main focus was generating information regarding different livestock diseases considered important by villagers and their relevance, as well as obtaining knowledge concerning hunting activities and cooking methods to gain a better understanding of the interrelationship of people and animals and the diseases of their animals. For poultry, an overall prevalence of 41 % of Newcastle disease was found by means of the ELISA test by antibody detection, chicken being the most affected species in the village. No samples were positive to avian influenza with the HI test. No virus was isolated by means of the tracheal or cloaca swabbing of ducks. For hunting: All species could be hunted by chance at any time of the year. There was a difference in species hunted between seasons, peccaries being more frequently hunted during the dry season and in contrast, deer and wild avian during the rainy season. For cooking: Villagers did not consume any raw meat. The cooking methods depended on the species. Stewing was the most favoured method for peccaries, wild birds, tepezcuintle and domestic poultry, whereas grilling was preferable for deer, roasting for armadillos and marinating for pork. According to the generated information, the most important domestic livestock species in the village are chickens and pigs, chickens being the most affected by diseases. No evident health problems on pigs were observed in this study. Hunting was shown as an activity enhanced by poverty and the lack of employment opportunities in the village and was mostly directed at larger species such as deer and peccaries. From the viewpoint of a transmission of zoonoses from animals to humans cooking methods mostly reflected a protective factor as no raw meat was eaten, stews and broths being the most common forms of cooking, involving an exposure of meat to high temperatures. Nonetheless, both agricultural and hunting activities represent a risk factor for the spread of diseases as hunters may act as mechanical vectors for different pathogens within domestic and wild animal populations.","meta":{"paper_id":"40ab93e7916aabc26190092d088a37d43b3240fc","title":"Participatory epidemiology at the neotropics: study of diseases of backyard livestock and description of hunting patterns in Uaxact\u00fan, Maya Reserve Biosphere, Guatemala"}}
{"text":"Background: We aimed to investigate the effects of ambient respiratory viral infections in the general population on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development. Methods: Data of weekly incident RA (2012RA ( -2013 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database, and those of weekly observations on eight respiratory viral infections were obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database. We estimated the percentage change in incident RA associated with ambient mean respiratory viral infections using a generalized linear model, after adjusting for time trend, air pollution, and meteorological data. Results: A total of 24,117 cases of incident RA (mean age 54.7 years, 18,688 [77.5%] women) were analyzed. Ambient respiratory viral infections in the population were associated with a higher number of incident RA over time, and its effect peaked 6 or 7 weeks after exposure. Among the 8 viruses, parainfluenza virus (4.8% for 1% respiratory viral infection increase, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.1, P = .003), coronavirus (9.2%, 3.9 to 14.8, P < .001), and metapneumovirus (44%, 2.0 to 103.4, P = .038) were associated with increased number of incident RA. The impact of these respiratory viral infections remained significant in women (3.8%, 12.1%, and 67.4%, respectively, P < .05) and in older patients (10.7%, 14.6%, and 118.2%, respectively, P < .05). Conclusions: Ambient respiratory viral infections in the population were associated with an increased number of incident RA, especially in women and older patients, suggesting that respiratory viral infections can be a novel environmental risk factor for the development of RA.","meta":{"paper_id":"8880ca1de9ca704b6b0af29fd6c181457663ac40","title":"Respiratory viral infections and the risk of rheumatoid arthritis"}}
{"text":"The implementation of expanded newborn screening programs reduced mortality and morbidity in medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) caused by mutations in the ACADM gene. However, the disease is still potentially fatal. Missense induced MCADD is a protein misfolding disease with a molecular loss-of-function phenotype. Here we established a comprehensive experimental setup to analyze the structural consequences of eight ACADM missense mutations (p.Ala52Val, p.Tyr67His, p.Tyr158His, p.Arg206Cys, p.Asp266Gly, p.Lys329Glu, p.Arg334Lys, p.Arg413Ser) identified after newborn screening and linked the corresponding protein misfolding phenotype to the site of side-chain replacement with respect to the domain. With fever being the crucial risk factor for metabolic decompensation of patients with MCADD, special emphasis was put on the analysis of structural and functional derangements related to thermal stress. Based on protein conformation, thermal stability and kinetic stability, the molecular phenotype in MCADD depends on the structural region that is affected by missense-induced conformational changes with the central b-domain being particularly prone to structural derangement and destabilization. Since systematic classification of conformational derangements induced by ACADM mutations may be a helpful tool in assessing the clinical risk of patients, we scored the misfolding phenotype of the variants in comparison to p.Lys329Glu (K304E), the classical severe mutation, and p.Tyr67His (Y42H), discussed to be mild. Experiments assessing the impact of thermal stress revealed that mutations in the ACADM gene lower the temperature threshold at which MCAD loss-of-function occurs. Consequently, increased temperature as it occurs during intercurrent infections, significantly increases the risk of further conformational derangement and loss of function of the MCAD enzyme explaining the life-threatening clinical courses observed during fever episodes. Early and aggressive antipyretic treatment thus may be life-saving in patients suffering from MCADD. Variant Medium-Chain acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase.

{"text":"Evidence suggests that reduced intake of fruit and vegetables may play a critical role in the development of asthma and allergies. The present review aimed to summarize the evidence for the association between fruit and vegetable intake, risk of asthma\/wheeze and immune responses. Databases including PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched up to June 2016. Studies that investigated the effects of fruit and vegetable intake on risk of asthma\/wheeze and immune responses were considered eligible (n = 58). Studies used cross-sectional (n = 30), cohort (n = 13), case-control (n = 8) and experimental (n = 7) designs. Most of the studies (n = 30) reported beneficial associations of fruit and vegetable consumption with risk of asthma and\/or respiratory function, while eight studies found no significant relationship. Some studies (n = 20) reported mixed results, as they found a negative association between fruit only or vegetable only, and asthma. In addition, the meta-analyses in both adults and children showed inverse associations between fruit intake and risk of prevalent wheeze and asthma severity (p < 0.05). Likewise, vegetable intake was negatively associated with risk of prevalent asthma (p < 0.05). Seven studies examined immune responses in relation to fruit and vegetable intake in asthma, with n = 6 showing a protective effect against either systemic or airway inflammation. Fruit and vegetable consumption appears to be protective against asthma. Nutrients 2017, 9, 341 2 of 26 asthma exacerbations [4, 5] . The considerable morbidity related to asthma may be ameliorated by addressing modifiable risk factors such as diet [6] . It has been suggested that the increased prevalence of asthma in recent decades may be associated with changes in dietary habits since the 1950s-particularly, deficiency in dietary antioxidants [7] . The Western diet has shifted towards less fruit and vegetables, and high intakes of convenience foods that are low in fibre and antioxidants and rich in saturated fats [8, 9] . Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathophysiology of asthma, due to chronic activation of airway inflammatory cells [10] . There is ample evidence that oxidative stress can have various deleterious effects on airway function, including airway smooth muscle contraction, induction of BHR, mucus hypersecretion, epithelial shedding and vascular exudation [11, 12] . Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), which results in a cascade of events involving upregulation of the transcription of various inflammatory cytokine genes, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and eventually influx and degranulation of airway neutrophils [8] . Fresh fruit and vegetables provide rich sources of antioxidants and other biologically active substances (such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids and polyphenolic compounds) [12] . Studies have shown that diets with low average consumption of fruit and vegetables play a major role in the development of allergic diseases [1, 7] , and may augment oxidative stress in asthma [13] . Antioxidants can reduce airway inflammation via protecting the airways against oxidants by both endogenous (activated inflammatory cells) and exogenous (such as air pollution, cigarette smoke) sources [7] . Moreover, dietary antioxidants present in fruit and vegetables can scavenge ROS, and thus inhibit NF\u03baB-mediated inflammation, while diets low in antioxidants have reduced capacity to respond to oxidative stress [8] . Currently available asthma medications, such as glucocorticoids, are ineffective in some cases such as viral-induced exacerbations [14] ; and prolonged treatment with these therapeutic agents can result in adverse effects, such as pneumonia, cataracts, and osteoporosis [15] . Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions are required to reduce the burden of asthma in both adults and children. Understanding the roles of dietary nutrients in asthma and asthma-related complications may help in the management of this chronic inflammatory disease. Hence, a systematic review of the intake of fruits and vegetables and their effects on immune responses and asthma risk is of interest. This paper aimed to describe studies investigating the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on risk of asthma and wheezing and immune responses (including immune responses to virus infection and inflammation) in asthma and wheezing. Methods PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were included in the literature search, which was conducted in June 2016, including all previously published articles. Studies were limited to humans with no language restrictions. Additional studies were identified by hand searching references from the identified studies. See Figure 1 for an example of the search strategy. Only original studies with the following designs were included: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, before and after studies, and cross sectional studies. Case studies, case reports, animal studies, opinion papers, in vitro studies and conference abstracts were excluded. Review articles were collected for the purposes of reviewing the reference list and did not contribute to the final number of included studies. The target study population was human of all age, gender or ethnicity, with asthma, wheeze, airway inflammation or other related respiratory symptoms.

{"text":"Background: Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common contraindication to elective surgery. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. Methods: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. Results: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino\/enterovirus (HRV\/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV\/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. Conclusions: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.","meta":{"paper_id":"f849d3e71f4d2eae8a1e39802195bc9c06fc30ae","title":"Respiratory virus associated with surgery in children patients"}}
{"text":"The Tasmanian devil is an endangered carnivorous marsupial threatened by devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). While research on DFTD has been extensive, little is known about viruses in devils and whether any are of potential conservation relevance for this endangered species. Using both metagenomics based on virion enrichment and sequence-independent amplification (virion-enriched metagenomics) and metatranscriptomics based on bulk RNA sequencing, we characterized and compared the fecal viromes of captive and wild devils. A total of 54 fecal samples collected from two captive and four wild populations were processed for virome characterization using both approaches. In total, 24 novel marsupial-related viruses, comprising a sapelovirus, astroviruses, rotaviruses, picobirnaviruses, parvoviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, and a gammaherpesvirus, were identified, as well as known mammalian pathogens such as rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus 2. Captive devils showed significantly lower viral diversity than wild devils. Comparison of the two virus discovery approaches revealed substantial differences in the number and types of viruses detected, with metatranscriptomics better suited for RNA viruses and virion-enriched metagenomics largely identifying more DNA viruses. Thus, the viral communities revealed by virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics were not interchangeable and neither approach was able to detect all viruses present. An integrated approach using both virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics constitutes a powerful tool for obtaining a complete overview of both the taxonomic and functional profiles of viral communities within a sample. IMPORTANCE The Tasmanian devil is an iconic Australian marsupial that has suffered an 80% population decline due to a contagious cancer, devil facial tumor disease, along with other threats. Until now, viral discovery in this species has been confined to one gammaherpesvirus (dasyurid herpesvirus 2 [DaHV-2]), for which captivity was identified as a significant risk factor. Our discovery of 24 novel marsupial-associated RNA and DNA viruses, and that viral diversity is lower in captive than in wild devils, has greatly expanded our knowledge of gut-associated viruses in devils and provides important baseline information that will contribute to the conservation and captive management of this endangered species. Our results also revealed that a combination of virion-enriched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics may be a more comprehensive approach for virome characterization than either method alone. Our results thus provide a springboard for continuous improvements in the way we study complex viral communities.","meta":{"paper_id":"3df56c2e76799309cc7bdbc5ef8f968a1569a08c","title":"Fecal Viral Diversity of Captive and Wild Tasmanian Devils Characterized Using Virion-Enriched Metagenomics and Metatranscriptomics GENETIC DIVERSITY AND EVOLUTION crossm"}}
{"text":"Background: Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is associated with respiratory infections in cattle of all ages; however, a temporal study to evaluate the effect of BCV immunity on virus shedding and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) incidence in pre-weaned beef calves has not been reported. Thus, we report here a prospective study in three herds of crossbred beef calves (n = 817) with endemic BCV. Serial blood samples for measurement of serum anti-BCV antibody titers and nasal swabs for detection of BCV and other common viral and bacterial BRD pathogens were collected from all calves or subsets of calves at predetermined times from birth through weaning. The calves were monitored for BRD and those that developed signs of respiratory disease were sampled for diagnostic testing. To discover additional risk factors that could have influenced BRD development, sequence analysis of the BCV strain(s) circulating in each herd, and the prevalence of common opportunistic bacterial pathogens in the upper respiratory tract of sick and apparently healthy cattle were also evaluated. Results: Two hundred forty-eight of the 817 study calves (30.4%) were treated for BRD prior to weaning; 246 of those were from a single herd involved in two outbreaks of BRD leading to mass treatment of all calves in that group. Molecular diagnostic testing found BCV and Histophilus somni in nasal swabs taken at the time of BRD treatment. Between herd analyses revealed anti-BCV serum antibody abundance did not associate with the incidence of BRD or BCV shedding, though these measurements may have been hindered by the long periods between sample collections. Analysis of the BCV spike gene hypervariable region revealed four polymorphisms in 15 isolates from the three herds, making strain variation unlikely to account for differences in treatment rates between herds. Persistent or recurrent shedding episodes of BCV occurred in some animals treated for BRD. Conclusion: Co-detection of BCV and H. somni at the time of the disease outbreak suggests that these pathogens contributed to disease pathogenesis. Developing appropriate control measures for respiratory BCV infections may help decrease the incidence of pre-weaning BRD. The role of antibodies in protection must still be further defined.","meta":{"paper_id":"26762988147d906e873f16c6e03cbb2ad7c46ea1","title":"Longitudinal study of humoral immunity to bovine coronavirus, virus shedding, and treatment for bovine respiratory disease in pre-weaned beef calves"}}

{"text":"Emergence and transmission of infectious diseases have an enormous impact on the poultry industry and present a serious threat to the health of humans and wild birds. Noncommercial poultry operations, such as backyard poultry facilities in China, are potential sources of virus exchange between commercial poultry and wild birds. It is particularly critical in wetland areas where backyard poultry have close contact with commercial poultry and migratory birds, therefore increasing the risk of contracting infectious diseases. To evaluate the transmission risks, a cross-sectional study was undertaken in the Poyang Lake area, China, involving 309 residents in the backyard poultry farms in three counties (Region A, B, and C) of Jiangxi Province. We examined the backyard poultry population, poultry species, presence of poultry deaths from infectious diseases, food sources, and biosecurity practices. Region B ranked highest for biosecurity while region C ranked lowest. The risks of infectious diseases were assessed by adjusted odds ratio based on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Potential risk factors in the three regions of the study site were compared. In Region A, significant factor was contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 6.573, 95% CI: 2.148-20.115, P=0.001). In Region B, the most significant factor was contact of poultry with neighboring backyard waterfowls (OR: 3.967, 95% CI: 1.555-10.122, P=0.004). In Region C, significant factors were poultry purchase from local live bird markets (OR: 3.740, 95% CI: 1.243-11.255, P=0.019), and contact of poultry with wild birds (OR: 3.379, 95% CI: 1.058-10.791, P=0.040). In summary, backyard poultry was significantly affected by neighboring commercial poultry and close contact with wild birds. The results are expected to improve our understanding of the transmission risks of infectious diseases in a typical backyard poultry environment in rural China, and address the need to improve local farming practices and take preventive measures.","meta":{"paper_id":"a523dca1cc7a585e2433acb959f3d396f35b9c79","title":"Risk Factors for Infectious Diseases in Backyard Poultry Farms in the Poyang Lake Area"}}

{"text":"Background: Phylodynamics, the study of the interaction between epidemiological and pathogen evolutionary processes within and among populations, was originally defined in the context of rapidly evolving viruses and used to characterize transmission dynamics. The concept of phylodynamics has evolved since the early 21 st century, extending its reach to slower-evolving pathogens, including bacteria and fungi, and to the identification of influential factors in disease spread and pathogen population dynamics. Results: The phylodynamic approach has now become a fundamental building block for the development of comparative phylogenetic tools capable of incorporating epidemiological surveillance data with molecular sequences into a single statistical framework. These innovative tools have greatly enhanced scientific investigations of the temporal and geographical origins, evolutionary history, and ecological risk factors associated with the growth and spread of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Zika, and dengue and bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

The model broadly hypothesizes disease emergence is driven by the co-incidence of genetic, physical environmental, ecological, and social factors. We developed and tested a model of the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 based on suspected convergence factors that are mainly associated with land-use change. Building on previous geospatial statistical studies that identified natural and human risk factors associated with urbanization, we added new factors to test whether causal mechanisms and pathogenic landscapes could be more specifically identified. Our findings suggest that urbanization spatially combines risk factors to produce particular types of peri-urban landscapes with significantly higher HPAI H5N1 emergence risk. The work highlights that peri-urban areas of Viet Nam have higher levels of chicken densities, duck and geese flock size diversities, and fraction of land under rice or aquaculture than rural and urban areas. We also found that land-use diversity, a surrogate measure for potential mixing of host populations and other factors that likely influence viral transmission, significantly improves the model's predictability. Similarly, landscapes where intensive and extensive forms of poultry production overlap were found at greater risk. These results support the convergence hypothesis in general and demonstrate the potential to improve EID prevention and control by combing geospatial monitoring of these factors along with pathogen surveillance programs.","meta":{"paper_id":"ee5b43d20a640664510cb7a540caaae4a8e19933","title":"Evidence for the Convergence Model: The Emergence of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (H5N1) in Viet Nam"}}

{"text":"Many genes have been implicated in schizophrenia as have viral prenatal or adult infections and toxoplasmosis or Lyme disease. Several autoantigens also target key pathology-related proteins. These factors are interrelated. Susceptibility genes encode for proteins homologous to those of the pathogens while the autoantigens are homologous to pathogens' proteins, suggesting that the risk-promoting effects of genes and risk factors are conditional upon each other, and dependent upon protein matching between pathogen and susceptibility gene products. Pathogens' proteins may act as dummy ligands, decoy receptors, or via interactome interference. Many such proteins are immunogenic suggesting that antibody mediated knockdown of multiple schizophrenia gene products could contribute to the disease, explaining the immune activation in the brain and lymphocytes in schizophrenia, and the preponderance of immune-related gene variants in the schizophrenia genome.

{"text":"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a novel infectious disease caused by a coronavirus (MERS-CoV) first reported in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. MERS later spread to other countries in the Arabian Peninsula, followed by an outbreak in South Korea in 2015. At least 26 countries have reported MERS cases, and these numbers may increase over time. Due to international travel opportunities, all countries are at risk of imported cases of MERS, even if outbreaks do not spread globally. Therefore, it is essential for emergency department (ED) personnel to be able to rapidly assess MERS risk and take immediate actions if indicated. The Identify-Isolate-Inform (3I) tool, originally conceived for initial detection and management of Ebola virus disease patients in the ED and later adjusted for measles, can be adapted for real-time use for any emerging infectious disease. This paper reports a modification of the 3I tool for use in initial detection and management of patients under investigation for MERS. Following an assessment of epidemiologic risk factors, including travel to countries with current MERS transmission and contact with patients with confirmed MERS within 14 days, patients are risk stratified by type of exposure coupled with symptoms of fever and respiratory illness.

{"text":"Background: Calf disease may result in great economic losses. To implement prevention strategies it is important to gain information on management and to point out risk factors. The objective of this internet based survey was to describe calf management practices on registered dairy breeding farms in Austria and to estimate differences in calf disease incidences depending on farm structure and management practices. Results: A total of 1287 questionnaires were finally analysed (response rate 12.2 %). Herd characteristics and regional distribution of farms indicated that this survey gives a good overview on calf management practices on registered dairy farms in Austria. The median number of cows per farm was 20 (interquartile range 13-30). Significant differences regarding farm characteristics and calf management between small and large farms (\u226420 vs >20 cows) were present. Only 2.8 % of farmers tested first colostrum quality by use of a hydrometer. Storing frozen colostrum was more prevalent on large farms (80.8 vs 64.2 %). On 85.1 % of the farms, whole milk, including waste milk, was fed to the calves. Milk replacer and waste milk were more often used on large farms. In accordance with similar studies from other countries, calf diarrhoea was indicated as the most prevalent disease. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that herd size was associated with calf diarrhoea and calf respiratory tract disease, with higher risk of disease on large farms. Furthermore, feeding waste milk to the calves was associated with increasing calf diarrhoea incidence on farm. In the final model with calf respiratory tract disease as outcome, respondents from organic farms reported less often a respiratory tract disease incidence of over 10 % compared with conventional farms [odds ratio (OR) 0.40, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.21-0.75] and farmers that housed calves individually or in groups after birth significantly reported more often to have an incidence of respiratory tract disease >10 % compared with farms where all calves were housed individually (OR 2.28, 95 % CI 1.16-4.48). The results obtained in this study provide an overview on calf management on dairy breeding farms in Austria and may help to further point out areas to be improved on farm.

Women infected during their second and third trimesters are at increased risk for severe cardiopulmonary complications, premature delivery, and death. Here, we establish a murine model of aerosolized influenza infection during pregnancy. We find significantly altered innate antiviral responses in pregnant mice, including decreased levels of IFN-b, IL-1a, and IFN-c at early time points of infection. We also find reduced cytotoxic T cell activity and delayed viral clearance. We further demonstrate that pregnancy levels of the estrogen 17-b-estradiol are able to induce key anti-inflammatory phenotypes in immune responses to the virus independently of other hormones or pregnancy-related stressors. We conclude that elevated estrogen levels result in an attenuated anti-viral immune response, and that pregnancy-associated morbidities occur in the context of this antiinflammatory phenotype.","meta":{"paper_id":"b3b492aee17ce67199d458de9b98bc219c2cbf3c","title":"Estrogen Mediates Innate and Adaptive Immune Alterations to Influenza Infection in Pregnant Mice"}}
{"text":"Host-range shifts in influenza virus are a major risk factor for pandemics. A key question in the study of emerging zoonoses is how the evolution of transmission efficiency interacts with heterogeneity in contact patterns in the new host species, as this interplay influences disease dynamics and prospects for control. Here we use a synergistic mixture of models and data to tease apart the evolutionary and demographic processes controlling a host-range shift in equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus (CIV). CIV has experienced 15 years of continuous transfer among dogs in the United States, but maintains a patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic short-lived outbreaks coupled with endemic hotspots in large animal shelters. We show that CIV has a high reproductive potential in these facilities (mean R 0 = 3.9) and that these hotspots act as refugia from the sparsely connected majority of the dog population. Intriguingly, CIV has evolved a transmission efficiency that closely matches the minimum required to persist in these refugia, leaving it poised on the extinction\/invasion threshold of the host contact network. Corresponding phylogenetic analyses show strong geographic clustering in three US regions, and that the effective reproductive number of the virus (R e ) in the general dog population is close to 1.0. Our results highlight the critical role of host contact structure in CIV dynamics, and show how host contact networks could shape the evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency. Importantly, efficient control measures could eradicate the virus, in turn minimizing the risk of future sustained transmission among companion dogs that could represent a potential new axis to the humananimal interface for influenza.","meta":{"paper_id":"64053a0785373722d802b6a2fac9db7489b1474e","title":"Contact Heterogeneity, Rather Than Transmission Efficiency, Limits the Emergence and Spread of Canine Influenza Virus"}}
{"text":"To estimate the proportion of healthcare workers (HCWs) willing to work during an influenza pandemic and identify associated risk factors, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis compliant with PRISMA guidance. Databases and grey literature were searched to April 2013, and records were screened against protocol eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I 2 = 99\u00c12%). Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23\u00c11% to 95\u00c18% willingness to work, depending on context. Meta-analyses of specific factors showed that male HCWs, physicians and nurses, full-time employment, perceived personal safety, awareness of pandemic risk and clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics, role-specific knowledge, pandemic response training, and confidence in personal skills were statistically significantly associated with increased willingness. Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness. HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable.

An early extensive clinical, laboratory, and imaging evaluation of \"at risk patients\" allows a correct diagnosis of ARDS, assessment of comorbidities, and calculation of prognostic indices, so that a careful treatment can be planned. Rapid administration of antibiotics and resuscitative measures in case of sepsis and septic shock associated with protective ventilatory strategies and early short-term paralysis associated with differential ventilatory techniques (recruitment maneuvers with adequate positive end-expiratory pressure titration, prone position, and new extracorporeal membrane oxygenation techniques) in severe ARDS can help improve its prognosis.

To investigate this issue, a cross-sectional survey was conducted at the ERs of King Abdul-Aziz Hospital, King Fahd Hospital, and Al-Thaghor Hospital in November 2013 with the aims of estimating emergency service utilization for non-urgent cases, identifying the predictors of ER utilization for non-urgent cases, and measuring patients' knowledge of primary healthcare centers (PHCCs). Patients were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and the data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. We recruited 300 patients; males comprised 50.7% of the sample. A higher proportion of patients with non-urgent cases visited the ER three to four times a year (P=0.001). A higher proportion of patients without emergencies had not attempted to visit an outpatient clinic before the ER (P=0.003). Most patients without emergencies thought the ER was the first place to consult in case of illness. Most patients who visited the ER were single, < 15 years, and had lower incomes. Patients requested ER services for primary care-treatable conditions because of limited services and resources as well as limited working hours at PHCCs. Most patients (90.0%) were knowledgeable about PHCCs, with those of lower education being more knowledgeable. Patients reported long ER waiting times (\u2265 3 hours), no organization (85.9%), and lack of medical staff. Overall, overuse of ER services is high at the Ministry of Health hospitals in Jeddah. The risk factors for ER overuse are age < 15 years, singlehood, and low incomes. Policy makers and health providers have a challenging task to control ER overuse. We recommend developing strategies to implement policies aimed at reducing non-urgent ER use as well as making healthcare services more available to the population.","meta":{"paper_id":"b562f1a519bc6a12df5e62930bdf4345cf0f7ce9","title":"Utilization of the Emergency Department and Predicting Factors Associated With Its Use at the Saudi Ministry of Health General Hospitals"}}

In this study, area level risk factors for both infections in 28,914 cats tested with ELISA were investigated by multivariable spatial Poisson regression models along with MAUP effect on spatial clustering and cluster detection (for postal codes, counties, and states) by Moran's test and spatial scan test, respectively. The study results indicate that the significance and magnitude of the association of risk factors with both infections varied with aggregation scale. Further more, Moran's test only identified spatial clustering at postal code and county levels of aggregation. Similarly, the spatial scan test indicated that the number, size, and location of clusters varied over aggregation scales. In conclusion, the association between infection and area was influenced by the choice of spatial scale and indicates the importance of study design and data analysis with respect to specific research questions.","meta":{"paper_id":"0910e151cd1fb8d455e54cd4e97f867627f934c8","title":"Research Article Disparities in Spatial Prevalence of Feline Retroviruses due to Data Aggregation: A Case of the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem"}}

Methods: Functional SNPs of FCGR2A (FccRIIA-131His.Arg, rs1801274), FCGR2B (FccRIIB-187Ile.Thr, rs1050501), FCGR2C (FccRIIC-13Gln.Stop, rs10917661), FCGR3A (FccRIIIA-158Val.Phe, rs396991), and FCGR3B variants (FccRIIIB NA1 and NA2) were genotyped in an asthma family cohort including 370 atopy positive, 239 atopy negative, and 169 asthma positive subjects. The genotype and phenotype data (asthma, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and atopy) of subjects were analyzed using family-based association tests (FBAT) and logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. Result: The FccRIIA-131His.Arg SNP is significantly associated with atopy in a family-based association test (P = 0.00287) and in a logistic regression analysis (P = 0.0269, OR 0.732, 95% CI: 0.555-0.965). The FccRIIA-131His (or rs1801274-A) allele capable of binding human IgG2 has a protective role against atopy.

{"text":"Novel infectious diseases continue to emerge within human populations. Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-tohuman transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and\/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R 0 \ufffd 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.","meta":{"paper_id":"572e7221874d7e5d1c4ed293e60f021ba1d59367","title":"Tissue tropism and transmission ecology predict virulence of human RNA viruses"}}

Mostly chronic hepatitis C virus has a uniform natural history, from liver cirrhosis to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. The current therapy for HCV infection consists of a combination of Pegylated interferon and ribavirin. On the other hand, HCV-related liver disease is also the leading indication for liver transplantation. However, posttransplant HCV re-infection of the graft has been reported to be universal. Furthermore, the graft after HCV re-infection often results in accelerated progression to liver failure. In addition, treatment of recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation is often compromised by enhanced adverse effects and limited efficacy of interferon-based therapies. Taken together, poor outcome after HCV re-infection, regardless of grafts or recipients, poses a major issue for the hepatologists and transplant surgeons. The aim of this paper is to review several specific aspects regarding HCV re-infection after transplant: risk factors, current therapeutics for HCV in different stages of liver transplantation, cellular function of HCV proteins, and molecular mechanisms of HCV entry. Hopefully, this paper will inspire new strategies and novel inhibitors against recurrent HCV infection after liver transplantation and greatly improve its overall outcome.","meta":{"paper_id":"43ea5663d460f9bc3ec53ceea11e85b6265a1fef","title":"New Insights in Recurrent HCV Infection after Liver Transplantation"}}
{"text":"Background: Europeans represent the majority of international travellers and clinicians encountering returned patients have an essential role in recognizing, and communicating travel-associated public health risks. To investigate the morbidity of travel associated infectious diseases in European travellers, we analysed diagnoses with demographic, clinical and travel-related predictors of disease, in 6957 ill returned travellers who presented in 2008 to EuroTravNet centres with a presumed travel associated condition. Results: Gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases accounted for 33% of illnesses, followed by febrile systemic illnesses (20%), dermatological conditions (12%) and respiratory illnesses (8%). There were 3 deaths recorded; a sepsis caused by Escherichia coli pyelonephritis, a dengue shock syndrome and a Plasmodium falciparum malaria. GI conditions included bacterial acute diarrhea (6.9%), as well as giardiasis and amebasis (2.3%). Among febrile systemic illnesses with identified pathogens, malaria (5.4%) accounted for most cases followed by dengue (1.9%) and others including chikungunya, rickettsial diseases, leptospirosis, brucellosis, Epstein Barr virus infections, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) and viral hepatitis. Dermatological conditions were dominated by bacterial infections, arthropod bites, cutaneous larva migrans and animal bites requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis and also leishmaniasis, myasis, tungiasis and one case of leprosy. Respiratory illness included 112 cases of tuberculosis including cases of multi-drug resistant or extensively drug resistant tuberculosis, 104 cases of influenza like illness, and 5 cases of Legionnaires disease. Sexually transmitted infections (STI) accounted for 0.6% of total diagnoses and included HIV infection and syphilis. A total of 165 cases of potentially vaccine preventable diseases were reported. Purpose of travel and destination specific risk factors was identified for several diagnoses such as Chagas disease in immigrant travellers from South America and P. falciparum malaria in immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa. Travel within Europe was also associated with health risks with distinctive profiles for Eastern and Western Europe. Conclusions: In 2008, a broad spectrum of travel associated diseases were diagnosed at EuroTravNet core sites. Diagnoses varied according to regions visited by ill travellers. The spectrum of travel associated morbidity also shows that there is a need to dispel the misconception that travel, close to home, in Europe, is without significant health risk.","meta":{"paper_id":"a64149dbac768a5fac5c4ca620c09c2dea2e2bf0","title":"Travel and migration associated infectious diseases morbidity in Europe, 2008"}}
{"text":"Millions of children are exposed to tuberculosis (TB) each year, many of which become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most children can immunologically contain or eradicate the organism without pathology developing. However, in a minority, the organism overcomes the immunological constraints, proliferates and causes TB disease. Each year a million children develop TB disease, with a quarter dying. While it is known that young children and those with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease, our understanding of risk factors for this transition is limited. The most immunologically disruptive process that can happen during childhood is infection with another pathogen and yet the impact of co-infections on TB risk is poorly investigated. Many diseases have overlapping geographical distributions to TB and affect similar patient populations. It is therefore likely that infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa may impact on the risk of developing TB disease following exposure and infection, although disentangling correlation and causation is challenging. As vaccinations also disrupt immunological pathways, these may also impact on TB risk. In this article we describe the pediatric immune response to M. tuberculosis and then review the existing evidence of the impact of co-infection with other pathogens, as well as vaccination, on the host response to M. tuberculosis. We focus on the impact of other organisms on the risk of TB disease in children, in particularly evaluating if co-infections drive host immune responses in an age-dependent way. We finally propose priorities for future research in this field. An improved understanding of the impact of co-infections on TB could assist in TB control strategies, vaccine development (for TB vaccines or vaccines for other organisms), TB treatment approaches and TB diagnostics.","meta":{"paper_id":"4ce5891928816eb6068228ce463b91ed70df44e1","title":"Examining the Complex Relationship Between Tuberculosis and Other Infectious Diseases in Children"}}

{"text":"Since its emergence in the 1990s, White Spot Disease (WSD) has had major economic and societal impact in the crustacean aquaculture sector. Over the years shrimp farming alone has experienced billion dollar losses through WSD. The disease is caused by the White Spot Syndrome Virus (WSSV), a large dsDNA virus and the only member of the Nimaviridae family. Susceptibility to WSSV in a wide range of crustacean hosts makes it a major risk factor in the translocation of live animals and in commodity products. Currently there are no effective treatments for this disease. Understanding the molecular basis of disease processes has contributed significantly to the treatment of many human and animal pathogens, and with a similar aim considerable efforts have been directed towards understanding host-pathogen molecular interactions for WSD. Work on the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis in aquatic crustaceans has been restricted by a lack of sequenced and annotated genomes for host species. Nevertheless, some of the key host-pathogen interactions have been established: between viral envelope proteins and host cell receptors at initiation of infection, involvement of various immune system pathways in response to WSSV, and the roles of various host and virus miRNAs in mitigation or progression of disease. Despite these advances, many fundamental knowledge gaps remain; for example, the roles of the majority of WSSV proteins are still unknown. In this review we assess current knowledge of how WSSV infects and replicates in its host, and critique strategies for WSD treatment.","meta":{"paper_id":"52662ce54ce7eec49dce4d7c0592075227729f3e","title":"Molecular Mechanisms of White Spot Syndrome Virus Infection and Perspectives on Treatments"}}

Results: A total of nine papers and 12 studies, with 1520 severe dengue and 1496 clinical dengue infection were included. The overall meta-analysis revealed significant associations between rs4804803 and severe dengue under the recession (GG versus GA\/AA: OR = 0.44, 95%CI, 0.23-0.82) and a codominant model (GG versus AA: OR = 0.43, 95%CI, 0.23-0.81), but sensitivity analysis indicated that the significant pooled ORs were not robust. The subgroup analysis suggested that the carrier of G in rs4804803 was a risk factor for severe dengue under dominant (GG\/GA versus AA: OR = 1.86,95%CI, 1.01-3.45), superdominant (GA versus GG\/AA: OR = 1.81,95%CI, 1.02-3.21) and a codominant (GA versus AA: OR=1.82,95%CI, 1.02-3.26) models in Asians, while it was a protective factor for severe dengue in South-central Americans under recessive (GG versus GA\/AA: OR = 0.27,95%CI, 0.10-0.70) and codominant (GG versus AA: OR=0.24,95%CI, 0.09-0.64) models. The results from subgroup analysis were robust. Conclusions: Dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) promoter-336G\/A (rs4804803) polymorphism is association with severe dengue, and it acts in different directions for Asians and South-central Americans.","meta":{"paper_id":"fc1c7fe95eca6c5aba24577043ad02c15bfce43a","title":"Different Associations between DC-SIGN Promoter-336G\/A (rs4804803) Polymorphism with Severe Dengue in Asians and South-Central Americans: a Meta-Analysis"}}
{"text":"Background: Falls are an issue of great public health concern. This study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. Urban environmental hazards are often place-specific and dependent upon the built features, landscape characteristics, and habitual activities. Therefore, falls must be examined with respect to local situations. Results: This paper uses spatial analysis methods to map fall occurrences and examine possible environmental attributes of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong. The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population. The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified. The analyses are also important preludes to establishing research hypotheses for more focused studies.","meta":{"paper_id":"cdbdc0b6176729a11ba5e08c708408592d189657","title":"Spatial analysis of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong"}}
{"text":"Background: Health care workers are at the frontline in the fight against infectious disease, and as a result are at a high risk of infection. During the 2014-2015 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, many health care workers contracted Ebola, some fatally. However, no members of the Chinese Anti-Ebola medical team, deployed to provide vital medical care in Liberia were infected. This study aims to understand how this zero infection rate was achieved. Methods: Data was collected through 15 in-depth interviews with participants from the People's Liberation Army of China medical team which operated the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center from October 2014 to January 2015 in Liberia. Data were analysed using systematic framework analysis. Results: This study found numerous bio-psycho-socio-behavioural risk factors that directly or indirectly threatened the health of the medical team working in the Chinese Ebola Treatment Center. These factors included social and emotional stress caused by: (1) the disruption of family and social networks; (2) adapting to a different culture; (3) and anxiety over social and political unrest in Liberia. Exposure to Ebola from patients and local co-workers, and the incorrect use of personal protective equipment due to fatigue was another major risk factor. Other risk factors identified were: (1) shortage of supplies; (2) lack of trained health personnel; (3) exposure to contaminated food and water; (4) and long working hours. Comprehensive efforts were taken throughout the mission to mitigate these factors. Every measure was taken to prevent the medical team's exposure to the Ebola virus, and to provide the medical team with safe, comfortable working and living environments. There were many challenges in maintaining the health safety of the team, such as the limited capability of the emergency command system (the standardized approach to the command, control, and coordination of an emergency response), and the lack of comprehensive international protocols for dealing with emerging infectious disease pandemics. Conclusions: The comprehensive and multidisciplinary measures employed to protect the health of the medical team proved successful even in Liberia's resource-limited setting. The global health community can learn valuable lessons from this experience which could improve the safety of health care workers in future emergencies. These lessons include: establishing capable command systems; implementing effective coordination mechanisms; providing adequate equipment; providing training for medical teams; investing in the development of global health professionals; and improving research on ways to protect health care workers.","meta":{"paper_id":"5f6cbbe720247466895b4469f21b0967b35feb5a","title":"Experiences and challenges in the health protection of medical teams in the Chinese Ebola treatment center, Liberia: a qualitative study"}}
{"text":"Background: Since its initial detection in May 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has spread rapidly throughout the US swine industry. Recently, contaminated feed was confirmed as a vehicle for PEDV infection of na\u00efve piglets. This research provides in vivo data supporting the ability of a liquid antimicrobial product to reduce this risk. Results: Sal CURB\u00ae (Kemin Industries, Des Moines, IA, USA) is a FDA-approved liquid antimicrobial used to control Salmonella contamination in poultry and swine diets. To test its effect against PEDV, Sal CURB\u00ae-treated feed was spiked with a stock isolate of PEDV (Ct = 25.22), which PEDV-na\u00efve piglets were allowed to ingest via natural feeding behavior (ad libitum) for a 14-day period. For the purpose of a positive control, a separate group of piglets was allowed to ingest non-treated (Sal CURB\u00ae-free) feed also spiked with stock PEDV (Ct = 25.22). A negative control group received PEDV-free feed. Clinical signs of PEDV infection (vomiting and diarrhea) and viral shedding in feces were observed in the positive control group 2-3 days post-consumption of non-treated feed. In contrast, no evidence of infection was observed in pigs fed Sal CURB\u00ae-treated feed or in the negative controls throughout the 14-day study period. In addition, the Sal CURB\u00ae-treated feed samples had higher (p < 0.0001) mean PEDV Ct values than samples from the positive control group. Conclusions: These data provide proof of concept that feed treated with Sal CURB\u00ae can serve as a means to reduce the risk of PEDV infection through contaminated feed. Furthermore, the results from the positive control group provide additional proof of concept regarding the ability of contaminated feed to serve as a risk factor for PEDV infection of na\u00efve piglets.","meta":{"paper_id":"db97b6fadbd7b65de3e513beec8f3eca89bac377","title":"An evaluation of a liquid antimicrobial (Sal CURB\u00ae) for reducing the risk of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus infection of na\u00efve pigs during consumption of contaminated feed"}}
{"text":"Background: Although feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) have similar risk factors and control measures, infection rates have been speculated to vary in geographic distribution over North America. Since both infections are endemic in North America, it was assumed as a working hypothesis that their geographic distributions were similar. Hence, the purpose of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the comparative geographical distribution of both viral infections. Counts of FIV (n=17,108) and FeLV (n=30,017) positive serology results (FIV antibody and FeLV ELISA) were obtained for 48 contiguous states and District of Columbia of the United States of America (US) from the IDEXX Laboratories website. The proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV infection was estimated for each administrative region and its geographic distribution pattern was visualized by a choropleth map. Statistical evidence of an excess in the proportional morbidity ratio from unity was assessed using the spatial scan test under the normal probability model. Results: This study revealed distinct spatial distribution patterns in the proportional morbidity ratio suggesting the presence of one or more relevant and geographically varying risk factors. The disease map indicates that there is a higher prevalence of FIV infections in the southern and eastern US compared to FeLV. In contrast, FeLV infections were observed to be more frequent in the western US compared to FIV. The respective excess in proportional morbidity ratio was significant with respect to the spatial scan test (p < 0.05). The observed variability in the geographical distribution of the proportional morbidity ratio of FIV to FeLV may be related to the presence of an additional or unique, but yet unknown, spatial risk factor. Putative factors may be geographic variations in specific virus strains and rate of vaccination. Knowledge of these factors and the geographical distributions of these infections can inform recommendations for testing, management and prevention. However, further studies are required to investigate the potential association of these factors with FIV and FeLV.","meta":{"paper_id":"a3d1def9eb134591e3d0b38dc1c1330745da34a0","title":"Comparison of the geographical distribution of feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus infections in the United States of America (2000-2011)"}}
{"text":"Background: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are reported to have similar risk factors and similar recommendations apply to manage infected cats. However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV\/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters. Results: In the multivariable random intercept model, the odds of FIV compared to FeLV positive ELISA results were greater for adults (OR = 2.09, CI: 1.50-2.92), intact males (OR = 3.14, CI: 1.85-3.76), neutered males (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.44-3.14), cats with outdoor access (OR = 2.58, CI: 1.85-3.76) and lower for cats with clinical illness (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.90). The variance components obtained from the model indicated clustering at the testing facility level. Conclusions: Risk factors that have a greater effect on FIV seropositivity include adulthood, being male (neutered or not) and having access to outdoors, while clinical illness was a stronger predictor for FeLV seropositivity. Further studies are warranted to assess the implications of these results for the management and control of these infections.","meta":{"paper_id":"72e37ddb3310bf50385723819244148ab9a787f2","title":"Comparison of risk factors for seropositivity to feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukemia virus among cats: a case-case study"}}
{"text":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a great public health concern globally. Although 83% of the globally confirmed cases have emerged in Saudi Arabia, the spatiotemporal clustering of MERS-CoV incidence has not been investigated. This study analysed the spatiotemporal patterns and clusters of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and March 2019. Temporal, seasonal, spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were performed using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest MERS-CoV infection risk. A strongly significant temporal cluster for MERS-CoV infection risk was identified between April 5 and May 24, 2014. Most MERS-CoV infections occurred during the spring season (41.88%), with April and May showing significant seasonal clusters. Wadi Addawasir showed a high-risk spatial cluster for MERS-CoV infection. The most likely high-risk MERS-CoV annual spatiotemporal clusters were identified for a group of cities (n = 10) in Riyadh province between 2014 and 2016. A monthly spatiotemporal cluster included Jeddah, Makkah and Taif cities, with the most likely high-risk MERS-CoV infection cluster occurring between April and May 2014. Significant spatiotemporal clusters of MERS-CoV incidence were identified in Saudi Arabia. The findings are relevant to control the spread of the disease. This study provides preliminary risk assessments for the further investigation of the environmental risk factors associated with MERS-CoV clusters. these included persons who handle live camels (e.g., camel workers, camel salesmen, camel shepherds, slaughterhouse workers, animal and waste transporters) and persons who administer medications to camels or clean camel medical equipment [6] [7] [8] . Nevertheless, most patients report no exposure to camels [9] . The global camel population is estimated at approximately 35 million camels [10]; of these, 95% are dromedary camels [11] . In Saudi Arabia, the camel is considered a national, socio-cultural heritage animal and is central in the livestock economy, as it is used for milk or meat and in a traditional race festival (locally known as Mazain al-Ibal) [12] . The number of camels in Saudi Arabia is estimated at more than 1.39 million heads [13] and has been growing annually by 5.2% since 1961 [10]. Information is lacking regarding the distribution of camels in Saudi Arabia. In June 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture launched an electronic system for numbering and tracking camels in order to create a database on them through the use of microchip implants [14] . This endeavor is a part of a wider initiative to control animal diseases and to create a database on each camel and its owner. The new project will help improve camel health and control the spread of zoonotic diseases. No permanent and sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed despite close contact with MERS-CoV-infected patients [15] . However, nosocomial transmission in healthcare facilities between patients and healthcare workers and between patients sharing spaces in healthcare facilities represents the main mode of human-to-human infection [16] . MERS-CoV outbreaks linked to healthcare settings have occurred in several countries, with the largest being in Saudi Arabia, especially in 2014 and 2015 [17] [18] [19] . This may be due to inadequate, inconsistent or incomplete compliance with infection prevention and control practices, limited isolation of suspected MERS-CoV patients and patient crowdedness [20] . Furthermore, household transmission was observed from patients to other household members, but this was less striking than other modes of transmission [15, 17, 18, 21] . In Saudi Arabia, the probable risk factors for MERS-CoV infection were older age [20, 22] , male sex [22] , exposure to dromedary camels, comorbidities and smoking [23] . For household transmission, the identified risk factors were sleeping in an index patient's room, removing a patient's waste or touching respiratory secretions [21] . The factors related to MERS-CoV mortality were mainly old age and the existence of underlying comorbidities [22, 24] . The spread of an infectious disease is an instance of spatiotemporal diffusion processes at work, in which the emergence of the disease moves across space and changes in extent over time [25] . Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26, 27] . Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28] . However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31]. Considering the space and time dimensions of the MERS-CoV, one study highlighted that","meta":{"paper_id":"7e84a68e753fa2734beff117c24743d13b021c82","title":"Spatiotemporal Clustering of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) Incidence in Saudi Arabia, 2012-2019"}}
{"text":"Bats are reservoir hosts of several high-impact viruses that cause significant human diseases, including Nipah virus, Marburg virus and rabies virus. They also harbor many other viruses that are thought to have caused disease in humans after spillover into intermediate hosts, including SARS and MERS coronaviruses. As is usual with reservoir hosts, these viruses apparently cause little or no pathology in bats. Despite the importance of bats as reservoir hosts of zoonotic and potentially zoonotic agents, virtually nothing is known about the host\/virus relationships; principally because few colonies of bats are available for experimental infections, a lack of reagents, methods and expertise for studying bat antiviral responses and immunology, and the difficulty of conducting meaningful field work. These challenges can be addressed, in part, with new technologies that are species-independent that can provide insight into the interactions of bats and viruses, which should clarify how the viruses persist in nature, and what risk factors might facilitate transmission to humans and livestock.","meta":{"paper_id":"0b875918f93152038d3a87f24e51abc1fd99a348","title":"Immunology of Bats and Their Viruses: Challenges and Opportunities"}}
{"text":"Background: Host genetic factors may play a role in the occurrence and progress of SARS-Cov infection. This study was to investigate the relationship between tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 gene polymorphisms with the occurrence of SARS-CoV infection and its role in prognosis of patients with lung interstitial fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis. The association between genetic polymorphisms of TNF-\u03b1 gene and susceptibility to severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) was conducted in a hospital-based case-control study including 75 SARS patients, 41 health care workers and 92 healthy controls. Relationships of TNF\u03b1 gene polymorphisms with interstitial lung fibrosis and femoral head osteonecrosis were carried out in two case-case studies in discharged SARS patients. PCR sequencing based typing (PCR-SBT) method was used to determine the polymorphisms of TNF-\u03b1 gene in locus of the promoter region and univariate logistic analysis was conducted in analyzing the collected data. Results: Compared to TT genotype, the CT genotype at the -204 locus was found associated with a protective effect on SARS with OR(95%CI) of 0.95(0.90-0.99). Also, TT genotype, CT and CC were found associated with a risk effect on femoral head necrosis with ORs(95%CI) of 5.33(1.39-20.45) and 5.67(2.74-11.71), respectively and the glucocorticoid adjusted OR of CT was 5.25(95%CI 1.18-23.46) and the combined (CT and CC) genotype OR was 6.0 (95%CI 1.60-22.55) at -1031 site of TNF-\u03b1 gene. At the same time, the -863 AC genotype was manifested as another risk effect associated with femoral head necrosis with OR(95%CI) of 6.42(1.53-26.88) and the adjusted OR was 8.40(95%CI 1.76-40.02) in cured SARS patients compared to CC genotype. Conclusion: SNPs of TNF-\u03b1 gene of promoter region may not associate with SARS-CoV infection. And these SNPs may not affect interstitial lung fibrosis in cured SARS patients. However, the -1031CT\/CC and -863 AC genotypes may be risk factors of femoral head necrosis in discharged SARS patients.","meta":{"paper_id":"5e9ccecdd40825f5c30da3a900fc5cf1b063b47d","title":"BMC Infectious Diseases Roles of TNF-\u03b1 gene polymorphisms in the occurrence and progress of SARS-Cov infection: A case-control study"}}

We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed casepatients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (\u00b1 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. Results: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15\/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2\/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15\/100,000 in Hoima and 47\/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness.

Aim: The research was conducted to determine the seroprevalence and risk factor associated with respiratory viral pathogens in dual-purpose cattle of Aguachica, Rio de Oro and La Gloria municipalities in Cesar department, Colombia. The seroprevalence study was done from the random sampling (n=1000) of blood collected from 29 dual-purpose herds, located in three municipalities (Aguachica, Rio de Oro, and La Gloria) of Cesar department. The presence of antibodies against bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), and bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPI-3V) in the samples was detected by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Epidemiological data were obtained using a questionnaire administered to the owner or manager of each herd. The overall highest seroprevalence was observed for BHV-1 (94.7%), followed by BRSV (98.6%), BVDV (35.2%), and BPI-3V (47.1%). Regarding the seroprevalence by municipalities, there was a statistical association (p<0.05) for BVDV; however, for BRSV, BHV-1, and BPI-3V, no statistical association was found (p>0.05) between seropositive values and the municipalities, indicating that animal was seropositive in similar proportions in the three municipalities.

{"text":"Background: While the risk of severe complications of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and its determinants have been explored in previous studies, a systematic analysis of published articles with different designs and populations has yet to be conducted. The present study aimed to systematically review the risk of death associated with MERS as well as risk factors for associated complications. Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for clinical and epidemiological studies on confirmed cases of MERS. Eligible articles reported clinical outcomes, especially severe complications or death associated with MERS. Risks of admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation and death were estimated. Subsequently, potential associations between MERS-associated death and age, sex, underlying medical conditions and study design were explored. Results: A total of 25 eligible articles were identified. The case fatality risk ranged from 14.5 to 100%, with the pooled estimate at 39.1%. The risks of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation ranged from 44.4 to 100% and from 25.0 to 100%, with pooled estimates at 78.2 and 73.0%, respectively. These risks showed a substantial heterogeneity among the identified studies, and appeared to be the highest in case studies focusing on ICU cases. We identified older age, male sex and underlying medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, renal disease, respiratory disease, heart disease and hypertension, as clinical predictors of death associated with MERS. In ICU case studies, the expected odds ratios (OR) of death among patients with underlying heart disease or renal disease to patients without such comorbidities were 0.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.1, 4.3) and 0.6 (95% CI: 0.0, 2.1), respectively, while the ORs were 3.8 (95% CI: 3.4, 4.2) and 2.4 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.9), respectively, in studies with other types of designs. Conclusions: The heterogeneity for the risk of death and severe manifestations was substantially high among the studies, and varying study designs was one of the underlying reasons for this heterogeneity. A statistical estimation of the risk of MERS death and identification of risk factors must be conducted, particularly considering the study design and potential biases associated with case detection and diagnosis.","meta":{"paper_id":"ca5c35779ac657261ff729dd0f8509e1b14a6acd","title":"Clinical determinants of the severity of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS): a systematic review and meta-analysis"}}
{"text":"Background: Livestock herds are interconnected with each other via an intricate network of transports of animals which represents a potential substrate for the spread of epidemic diseases. We analysed four years (2012-2015) of daily bovine transports to assess the risk of disease transmission and identify times and locations where monitoring would be most effective. Specifically, we investigated how the seasonal dynamics of transport networks, driven by the alpine summering and traditional cattle markets, affect the risk of epidemic outbreaks. Results: We found strong and consistent seasonal variation in several structural network measures as well as in measures for outbreak risk. Analysis of the consequences of excluding markets, dealers and alpine pastures from the network shows that markets contribute much more to the overall outbreak risk than alpine summering. Static descriptors of monthly transport networks were poor predictors of outbreak risk emanating from individual holdings; a dynamic measure, which takes the temporal structure of the network into account, gave better risk estimates. A stochastic simulation suggests that targeted surveillance based on this dynamic network allows a higher detection rate and smaller outbreak size at detection than compared to other sampling schemes. Conclusions: Dynamic measures based on time-stamped data-the outgoing contact chain-can give better risk estimates and could help to improve surveillance schemes. Using this measure we find evidence that even in a country with intense summering practice, markets continue being the prime risk factor for the spread of contagious diseases.","meta":{"paper_id":"4208f9c98e378d4959debc3ba361e9cc6972e814","title":"Dynamic network measures reveal the impact of cattle markets and alpine summering on the risk of epidemic outbreaks in the Swiss cattle population"}}

To provide insights into the pathogenesis of H7N9 virus infection, we compared risk factors, clinical presentation, and progression of patients hospitalized with H7N9, H5N1, and 2009 pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) virus infections. Methods. We compared individual-level data from patients hospitalized with infection by H7N9 (n = 123), H5N1 (n = 119; 43 China, 76 Vietnam), and pH1N1 (n = 3486) viruses. We assessed risk factors for hospitalization after adjustment for age-and sex-specific prevalence of risk factors in the general Chinese population. Results. The median age of patients with H7N9 virus infection was older than other patient groups (63 years; P < .001) and a higher proportion was male (71%; P < .02). After adjustment for age and sex, chronic heart disease was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization with H7N9 (relative risk, 9.68; 95% confidence interval, 5.24-17.9). H7N9 patients had similar patterns of leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated alanine aminotransferase, creatinine kinase, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase to those seen in H5N1 patients, which were all significantly different from pH1N1 patients (P < .005). H7N9 patients had a longer duration of hospitalization than either H5N1 or pH1N1 patients (P < .001), and the median time from onset to death was 18 days for H7N9 (P = .002) vs 11 days for H5N1 and 15 days for pH1N1 (P = .154).

A major limitation in the comparability of the data available is attributed to the differences in diagnostic techniques employed and cat populations sampled. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of L. infantum infection in owned cats across Italy by serological and molecular tests and the identification of potential risk factors. Blood samples from 2,659 cats from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy were tested for antibodies against L. infantum, by an immunofluorescence antibody test and for the parasites' DNA, by real-time PCR. Samples were additionally screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNAs. An overall cumulative L. infantum prevalence of 3.9% was recorded by serology (3.3%) and\/or qPCR (0.8%), with a higher rate (10.5%) in southern Italy. The risk of L. infantum infection in cats was significantly associated to the geographical areas (South vs North and Centre; p<0.0001), age class (from 19 months to 6 years old vs \ufffd18 months old, p = 0.0003), neutering status (not neutered vs neutered, p = 0.0028) and FIV infection (p = 0.0051).Though the role of cats in the epidemiology of L. infantum is still debated, our findings indicate that cats are exposed to and\/or infected by this protozoan, mainly in endemic regions of Italy. Hence, a standardization of procedures for a prompt diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats and for screening cat population is crucial for a better understanding of the epidemiology of feline leishmaniasis, and of the potential role of cats in the transmission cycle of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.

{"text":", Brazil, in the period of Background: The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections. Immunocompromised patients, healthcare workers (HCWs) and children contacts are at increased risk of acquiring the infection. However, the impact of asymptomatic infection in transmission has not been well studied. Objectives: this study evaluated the frequency and viral load (VL) of RSV in nasal swab samples of individuals with different risk factors for acquiring infection in a university hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: We included 196 symptomatic children and their 192 asymptomatic caregivers, 70 symptomatic and 95 asymptomatic HCWs, 43 samples from symptomatic HIV-positive outpatients, and 100 samples of asymptomatic HIV patients in the period of 2009-2013. Results: RSV infection was detected in 10.1% (70\/696) of samples, 4.4% (17\/387) of asymptomatic patients, and 17.1% (53\/309) from symptomatic patients. (P < .0001). The VL of symptomatic patients (4.7 log copies\/mL) was significantly higher compared to asymptomatic patients (2.3 log copies\/mL). RSV detection among asymptomatic caregivers (6.8%; 13\/192) was significantly higher compared to other asymptomatic adults, HIV and HCWs (2.0%; 4\/195; P = .0252). A close contact with an infected child at home was an important risk to RSV acquisition [OR 22.6 (95% CI 4.8-106.7)]. Children who possibly transmitted the virus to their asymptomatic contacts had significantly higher viral load than children who probably did not transmit (P < .0001).

The frequency of RSV detection in individuals with different risk factors for acquiring infection is described. Comparisons of viral load were also performed. The individuals included in this study were HCWs, HIV-infected patients, children, and caregivers of children with respiratory symptoms. | METHODS This was a cross-sectional study in which patients were enrolled through active recruitment. A total sample size of 696 nasal swab samples was established considering the 6 groups studied: symptomatic and asymptomatic healthcare workers; symptomatic and asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals; symptomatic children; asymptomatic caregivers of symptomatic children. The sample size was calculated to be sufficient to determine a prevalence of RSV at least up to 10%, with 90% confidence interval and a relative precision of 0.25 of the a priori estimated proportion. The goal of sampling was that we could determine the prevalence of RSV in 4 different groups.

{"text":"Calfhood diseases have a major impact on the economic viability of cattle operations. A three part review series has been developed focusing on calf health from birth to weaning. In this paper, the last of the three part series, we review disease prevention and management with particular reference to pneumonia, focusing primarily on the pre-weaned calf. Pneumonia in recently weaned suckler calves is also considered, where the key risk factors are related to the time of weaning. Weaning of the suckler calf is often combined with additional stressors including a change in nutrition, environmental change, transport and painful husbandry procedures (castration, dehorning). The reduction of the cumulative effects of these multiple stressors around the time of weaning together with vaccination programmes (preconditioning) can reduce subsequent morbidity and mortality in the feedlot. In most studies, calves housed individually and calves housed outdoors with shelter, are associated with decreased risk of disease. Even though it poses greater management challenges, successful group housing of calves is possible. Special emphasis should be given to equal age groups and to keeping groups stable once they are formed. The management of pneumonia in calves is reliant on a sound understanding of aetiology, relevant risk factors, and of effective approaches to diagnosis and treatment. Early signs of pneumonia include increased respiratory rate and fever, followed by depression. The single most important factor determining the success of therapy in calves with pneumonia is early onset of treatment, and subsequent adequate duration of treatment. The efficacy and economical viability of vaccination against respiratory disease in calves remains unclear.","meta":{"paper_id":"8abf33baca8c7abbbf6ca5f56b404b79f658dd26","title":"Calf health from birth to weaning.

Dromedary camels are the primary zoonotic reservoir for human infections. Interruption of the zoonotic transmission chain from camels to humans, therefore, may be an effective strategy to control the ongoing MERS-CoV outbreak. Here we show that vaccination with an adjuvanted MERS-CoV Spike protein subunit vaccine confers complete protection from MERS-CoV disease in alpaca and results in reduced and delayed viral shedding in the upper airways of dromedary camels. Protection in alpaca correlates with high serum neutralizing antibody titers. Lower titers of serum neutralizing antibodies correlate with delayed and significantly reduced shedding in the nasal turbinates of dromedary camels. Together, these data indicate that induction of robust neutralizing humoral immune responses by vaccination of na\u00efve animals reduces shedding that potentially could diminish the risk of zoonotic transmission. and virus isolation [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Serologic studies suggest that MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for at least three decades in regions as wide ranging as the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa [16] . The outbreak among human populations has persisted-albeit in low numbers-despite a lack of sustained human-to-human transmission [17, 18] . Data from molecular epidemiologic studies suggest that the outbreak has endured through multiple zoonotic spillover events from dromedary camels to humans. Additionally, several studies in Saudi Arabia and Qatar have demonstrated a clear epidemiologic link between camel and human populations [4, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Although MERS-CoV typically causes severe pneumonia in humans, the virus primarily infects the upper respiratory tract of dromedary camels, from where viable virus is shed in high quantities for approximately 7 days, and where viral RNA can be detected up to 35 days [27] . Occupational exposure that involves close proximity to infected dromedary camels is a major risk factor for human acquisition. This risk profile has been confirmed by studies in Saudi Arabia where camel herders and slaughterhouse workers were much more likely than the general population to either have serologic evidence of past exposure to 26] .

We identified 36 studies that investigated 19 risk factors for severe ALRI. Of these, 7 risk factors were significantly associated with severe ALRI in a consistent manner across studies, with the following meta-analysis estimates of odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals): low birth weight 3.18 (1.02-9.90), lack of exclusive breastfeeding 2.34 (1.42-3.88), crowding -more than 7 persons per household 1.96 (1.53-2.52), exposure to indoor air pollution 1.57 (1.06-2.31), incomplete immunization 1.83 (1.32-2.52), undernutrition -weight-for-age less than 2 standard deviations 4.47 (2.10-9.49), and HIV infection 4.15 (2.57-9.74).

{"text":"To extend knowledge on the heterogeneous neurological outcomes caused by TMEV and identify new models of human neurological diseases associated with antecedent infections, we analyzed the phenotypic consequences of TMEV infection in the Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse population. We evaluated 5 different CC strains for outcomes of long-term infection (3 months) and acute vs. early chronic infection (7 vs. 28 days post-infection), using neurological and behavioral phenotyping tests and histology. We correlated phenotypic observations with haplotypes of genomic regions previously linked to TMEV susceptibility to test the hypothesis that genomic diversity within CC mice results in variable disease phenotypes in response to TMEV. None of the 5 strains analyzed had a response identical to that of any other CC strain or inbred strain for which prior data are available, indicating that strains of the CC can produce novel models of neurological disease. Thus, CC strains can be a powerful resource for studying how viral infection can cause different neurological outcomes depending on host genetic background. Viral infections may precede the onset of several neurological conditions, including epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 1-14 . For each of these diseases, a viral infection in childhood or young adulthood is thought to initiate a chain of immunological events that, along with other risk factors, result in a cumulative increased susceptibility to disease. The risk and clinical manifestations conferred by antecedent viral infection can vary greatly among individuals even when infected by the same virus. Experimental studies using mice have uncovered mechanisms of infection, but common inbred and transgenic strains of mice typically do not reflect the genetic diversity and phenotypic heterogeneity observed in human populations. Consequently, the mechanisms responsible for variable responses to viral infection in humans remain largely unknown. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a naturally occurring neurotropic picornavirus affecting mice 15 . TMEV produces complications, which vary by mouse strain, that closely approximate human neurological conditions associated with antecedent viral infections. Moderately virulent strains (BeAn and DA) of TMEV establish a persistent infection resulting in demyelinating disease similar to MS in susceptible mouse strains such as SJL 16,17 and, to a lesser extent, CBA 18 . In susceptible mouse strains, TMEV infection is biphasic. The early period of infection (first 4 weeks) is characterized as an acute inflammatory phase, eliciting a strong anti-TMEV antibody response 19 along with an anti-TMEV T-cell response to clear the viral infection 20 . The later period of TMEV disease (from approximately 7 weeks post infection) is characterized by widespread neurodegeneration and chronic neuroinflammation 21,22 . In the TMEV-resistant strain C57BL\/6, TMEV infection causes epileptic seizures, but these mice clear the virus from the central nervous system (CNS) and do not develop chronic demyelination as seen in SJL mice 23, 24 . Depending on mouse strain, TMEV can infect motor neurons, resulting in lesions similar to ALS in humans 25 , or dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of CBA mice, similar to PD 26,27 . Since infection-associated neurological conditions in mice vary depending on genetic background, Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com\/scientificreports\/ 2 ScienTific REPORTS | 7: 12194 | TMEV infection can be used to model heterogeneous infection-associated human diseases to better understand the underlying genetic components.

The aims of this study were to estimate T. gondii seroprevalence in selected domestic cat breeds, and to evaluate whether being of a certain breed is associated with T. gondii seropositivity, when the age and lifestyle of the cat are taken into account. The studied breeds were the Birman, British Shorthair, Burmese, Korat, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ocicat, Persian, and Siamese. Plasma samples were analyzed for the presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies against T. gondii with a commercial direct agglutination test at dilution 1:40. The samples were accompanied by owner-completed questionnaires that provided background data on the cats. Overall, 41.12% of the 1121 cats tested seropositive, and the seroprevalence increased with age. The Burmese had the lowest seroprevalence (18.82%) and the Persian had the highest (60.00%). According to the final multivariable logistic regression model, the odds to test seropositive were four to seven times higher in Birmans, Ocicats, Norwegian Forest Cats, and Persians when compared with the Burmese, while older age and receiving raw meat were also risk factors for T. gondii seropositivity. This study showed that T. gondii seroprevalence varies by cat breed and identified being of certain breeds, older age, and receiving raw meat as risk factors for seropositivity.","meta":{"paper_id":"250615c975f713cb3e2b09e7e9718fa2eb095a79","title":"Toxoplasma gondii seroprevalence varies by cat breed K\u00e4 rt Must"}}
{"text":"Background: Streptococcus suis infection, an emerging zoonosis, is an increasing public health problem across South East Asia and the most common cause of acute bacterial meningitis in adults in Vietnam. Little is known of the risk factors underlying the disease. A case-control study with appropriate hospital and matched community controls for each patient was conducted between May 2006 and June 2009. Potential risk factors were assessed using a standardized questionnaire and investigation of throat and rectal S. suis carriage in cases, controls and their pigs, using real-time PCR and culture of swab samples. We recruited 101 cases of S. suis meningitis, 303 hospital controls and 300 community controls. By multivariate analysis, risk factors identified for S. suis infection as compared to either control group included eating ''high risk'' dishes, including such dishes as undercooked pig blood and pig intestine (OR 1 = 2.22; 95%CI = [1.15-4.28] and OR 2 = 4.44; 95%CI = [2.15-9.15]), occupations related to pigs (OR 1 = 3.84; 95%CI = [1.32-11.11] and OR 2 = 5.52; 95%CI = [1.49-20.39]), and exposures to pigs or pork in the presence of skin injuries (OR 1 = 7.48; 95%CI = [1.97-28.44] and OR 2 = 15.96; 95%CI = [2.97-85.72]). S. suis specific DNA was detected in rectal and throat swabs of 6 patients and was cultured from 2 rectal samples, but was not detected in such samples of 1522 healthy individuals or patients without S. suis infection. Conclusions: This case control study, the largest prospective epidemiological assessment of this disease, has identified the most important risk factors associated with S. suis bacterial meningitis to be eating 'high risk' dishes popular in parts of Asia, occupational exposure to pigs and pig products, and preparation of pork in the presence of skin lesions. These risk factors can be addressed in public health campaigns aimed at preventing S. suis infection. Citation: Ho DTN, Le TPT, Wolbers M, Cao QT, Nguyen VMH, et al.

Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted at a university hospital from January 2009 to March 2013. Study subjects included adults (aged \u226518 years) with pneumococcal pneumonia who had undergone laboratory tests for RVI. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors associated with severe pneumococcal pneumonia, defined as severity with the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) score \u226591. In total, 191 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia were included for analysis and stratified into 2 groups: the severe group with a PSI score \u226591 (n = 99) and the non-severe group with a PSI score <91 (n = 92). Preceding RVIs were detected in 48 patients, including influenza A virus (n = 20), influenza B virus (n = 4), parainfluenza viruses (n = 5), metapneumovirus (n = 4), rhinovirus (n = 4), respiratory syncytial viruses (n = 6), coronaviruses (n = 2), and mixed viral infections (n = 3).

The aim of this study was to evaluate non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) in preventing pediatric influenza infections. Methods: Laboratory confirmed influenza cases occurred during 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons matched by age and date of consultation. NPI (frequency of hand washing, alcohol-based hand sanitizer use and hand washing after touching contaminated surfaces) during seven days prior to onset of symptoms were obtained from parents of cases and controls. Results: Cases presented higher prevalence of underlying conditions such as pneumonia [OR = 3.23; 95 % CI: 1.38 -7.58 p = 0.007], asthma [OR = 2.45; 95 % CI: 1.17 -5.14 p = 0.02] and having more than 1 risk factor [OR = 1.67; 95 % CI: 0.99 -2.82 p = 0.05].

{"text":"Obesity and insulin resistance are primary risk factors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). NAFLD is generally exhibited by non-progressive simple steatosis. However, a significant subset of patient's progress to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) that is defined by the presence of steatosis, inflammation and hepatocyte injury with fibrosis. Unfortunately, there are no approved therapies for NAFLD or NASH and therefore therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Niclosamide is an U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved anthelmintic drug that mediates its effect by uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation. Niclosamide and its salt forms, Niclosamide Ethanolamine (NEN), and Niclosamide Piperazine (NPP) have shown efficacy in murine models of diet induced obesity characterized by attenuation of the prominent fatty liver disease phenotype and improved glucose metabolism. While the exact mechanism(s) underlying these changes remains unclear, the ability to uncouple oxidative phosphorylation leading to increased energy expenditure and lipid metabolism or attenuation of PKA mediated glucagon signaling in the liver have been proposed. Unfortunately, niclosamide has very poor water solubility, leading to low oral bioavailability. This, in addition to mitochondrial uncoupling activity and potential genotoxicity have reduced enthusiasm for its clinical use. More recently, salt forms of niclosamide, NEN and NPP, have demonstrated improved oral bioavailability while retaining activity. This suggests that development of safer more effective niclosamide derivatives for the treatment of NAFLD and Type 2 Diabetes may be possible. Herein we explored the ability of a series of N-substituted phenylbenzamide derivatives of the niclosamide salicylanilide chemotype to attenuate hepatic steatosis using a novel phenotypic in vitro model of fatty liver and the high fat diet-fed mouse model of diet induced obesity. These studies identified novel compounds with improved pre-clinical properties that attenuate hepatic steatosis in vitro and in vivo.

{"text":"Background: In natural cat populations, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is transmitted through bites between individuals. Factors such as the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals and hence appear as important population risk factors for FIV. Methodology\/Principal Findings: To study such population risk factors, we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern France. We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sexratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor.","meta":{"paper_id":"600e8fba699669f496224f1ab80caa3df030a77a","title":"Using Dynamic Stochastic Modelling to Estimate Population Risk Factors in Infectious Disease: The Example of FIV in 15 Cat Populations"}}
{"text":"Background: By September 2014, an outbreak of Ebola Viral Disease (EVD) in West African countries of Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal and Nigeria, had recorded over 4500 and 2200 probable or confirmed cases and deaths respectively. EVD, an emerging infectious disease, can create fear and panic among patients, contacts and relatives, which could be a risk factor for psychological distress. Psychological distress among this subgroup could have public health implication for control of EVD, because of potential effects on patient management and contact tracing. We determined the Prevalence, pattern and factors associated with psychological distress among survivors and contacts of EVD and their relatives. Methods: In a descriptive cross sectional study, we used General Health Questionnaire to assess psychological distress and Oslo Social Support Scale to assess social support among 117 participants who survived EVD, listed as EVD contacts or their relatives at Ebola Emergency Operation Center in Lagos, Nigeria. Factors associated with psychological distress were determined using chi square\/odds ratio and adjusted odds ratio. Results: The mean age and standard deviation of participants was 34 +\/ -9.6 years. Of 117 participants, 78 (66.7 %) were females, 77 (65.8 %) had a tertiary education and 45 (38.5 %) were health workers. Most frequently occurring psychological distress were inability to concentrate (37.6 %) and loss of sleep over worry (33.3 %). Losing a relation to EVD outbreak (OR = 6.0, 95 % CI, 1.2-32.9) was significantly associated with feeling unhappy or depressed while being a health worker was protective (OR = 0.4, 95 % CI, 0.2-0.9). Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) showed losing a relation (AOR = 5.7, 95 % CI, 1.2-28.0) was a predictor of \"feeling unhappy or depressed\", loss of a relation (AOR = 10.1, 95 % CI, 1.7-60.7) was a predictor of inability to concentrate. Conclusions: Survivors and contacts of EVD and their relations develop psychological distress. Development of psychological distress could be predicted by loss of family member. It is recommended that psychiatrists and other mental health specialists be part of case management teams. The clinical teams managing EVD patients should be trained on recognition of common psychological distress among patients. A mental health specialist should review contacts being monitored for EVD for psychological distress or disorders.","meta":{"paper_id":"d38f954f1b3937ead02257e75454dd9ad2ec0ce6","title":"An evaluation of psychological distress and social support of survivors and contacts of Ebola virus disease infection and their relatives in Lagos, Nigeria: a cross sectional study \u2212 2014"}}
{"text":"Pertussis, commonly referred to as \"whooping cough,\" is a highly contagious acute respiratory infection that has exhibited cyclical outbreaks throughout the last century. Although vaccines have provided some immunity, many populations, including infants and pregnant women, remain at risk for serious illness. Through the use of the novel \"Identify, Isolate, Inform\" (3I) tool, emergency department (ED) providers can readily recognize key symptoms of the disease and risk factors for exposure, thus curbing its transmission through early initiation of antimicrobial therapy and post-exposure prophylaxis. The three classic stages of pertussis include an initial catarrhal stage, characterized by nonspecific upper respiratory infection symptoms, which may advance to the paroxysmal stage, revealing the distinctive \"whooping cough.\" This cough can persist for weeks to months leading into the convalescent stage. Household contacts of patients with suspected pertussis or other asymptomatic, high-risk populations (infants, pregnant women in their third trimester, and childcare workers) may benefit from post-exposure prophylactic therapy. The Pertussis 3I tool can also alert healthcare professionals to the proper respiratory droplet precautions during contact with a symptomatic patient, as well as isolation practices until antimicrobial treatment is in progress. ED personnel should then inform local public health departments of any suspected cases. All of these actions will ultimately aid public health in controlling the incidence of pertussis cases, thus ensuring the protection of the general public from this re-emerging respiratory illness.

{"text":"The continuing circulation of MERS in the Middle East makes the international dissemination of the disease a permanent threat. To inform risk assessment, we investigated the spatiotemporal pattern of MERS global dissemination and looked for factors explaining the heterogeneity observed in transmission events following importation. Methods: We reviewed imported MERS cases worldwide up to July 2015. We modelled importations in time based on air travel combined with incidence in Middle East. We used the detailed history of MERS case management after importation (time to hospitalization and isolation, number of hospitals visited,\u2026) in logistic regression to identify risk factors for secondary transmission. We assessed changes in time to hospitalization and isolation in relation to collective and public health attention to the epidemic, measured by three indicators (Google Trends, ProMED-mail, Disease Outbreak News). Results: Modelled importation events were found to reproduce both the temporal and geographical structure of those observedthe Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted and observed monthly time series was large (r = 0.78, p < 10 \u22124 ). The risk of secondary transmission following importation increased with the time to case isolation or death (OR = 1.7 p = 0.04) and more precisely with the duration of hospitalization (OR = 1.7, p = 0.02). The average daily number of secondary cases was 0.02 [0.0,0.12] in the community and 0.20 [0.03,9.0] in the hospital. Time from hospitalisation to isolation decreased in periods of high public health attention (2.33 \u00b1 0.34 vs. 6.44 \u00b1 0.97 days during baseline attention).

These rates were adjusted for each of the remaining 8 provinces based on their prevalence of risk factors for pneumonia and healthcare-seeking behavior. We estimated non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI from healthcare utilization surveys at two sites and used the percent of SARI cases positive for influenza from sentinel surveillance to derive the influenza-associated SARI rate. We applied rates of hospitalized and non-hospitalized influenza-associated SARI to census data to calculate the national number of cases. The percent of SARI cases that tested positive for influenza ranged from 7-17% depending on age group, year, province and HIV status.

Seventy per cent of the travellers who suffered cough episodes developed their first symptoms within 3 days, suggesting a human to human transmission of the responsible pathogen, with short incubation time as evidenced by a bimodal distribution of cough in two peaks at a 24 h interval. None of demographical and socioeconomic characteristics, underlying diseases or vaccination against influenza significantly affected the occurrence of cough. Diabetes correlated with an increased risk of febrile cough (OR = 2.02 (1.05-3.89)) as well as unemployment ). Use of statins had no significant influence on the occurrence of cough and\/or fever during the pilgrimage. This result suggests that while treatment with a statin has been demonstrated to reduce the mortality from severe sepsis associated with respiratory tract infections, it probably does not play a role in the outcome of regular febrile cough episodes as observed in the cohort studied here.","meta":{"paper_id":"4e0e3408b8be8fabde40e804af36d5d0ee3078b2","title":"Incidence of Hajj-associated febrile cough episodes among French pilgrims: a prospective cohort study on the influence of statin use and risk factors"}}

Beijing has undergone significant socioeconomic changes in last decade, however no large-scale community epidemiological surveys of MDD have been conducted in Beijing since 2003. Aims: To determine the prevalence of MDD and its socio-demographic correlates in a representative household sample of the general population in Beijing, China. Method: Data were collected from the 2010 representative household epidemiological survey of mental disorders in Beijing. The multistage cluster random sampling method was used to select qualified subjects in 18 districts and counties, and then face-to-face interviews were administered using the Chinese version of Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders-Patient Edition (SCID-I\/P) during Results: 19,874 registered permanent residents were randomly identified and 16,032 (response rate\u00bc80.7%) completed face-to-face interviews. The time-point and life-time prevalence rates of MDD were estimated to be 1.10% (95% CI: 0.94-1.26%) and 3.56% (95% CI: 3.27-3.85%) respectively. Significant differences were found in sex, age, location of residence, marital status, education, employment status, personal\/family monthly income, perception of family environment and relationship with others, when comparing residents with MDD to those without MDD. Those who were female, aged 45 or above, reported low family income, or reported an \"average\" or \"poor\" family environment were associated with a higher risk of MDD. Conclusions: The prevalence of MDD reported in this survey is relatively lower than that in other western countries. Female sex, age older than 45, low family income, and poor family environment appear to be independent risk factors for MDD.","meta":{"paper_id":"32b6079c752664c2fd6e27194f5bb71b2c0379f5","title":"Prevalence of major depressive disorder and socio-demographic correlates: Results of a representative household epidemiological survey in Beijing, China"}}
{"text":"The current paradigm of allergy pathogenesis is that allergy develops in individuals with a genetic predisposition only after they are exposed to allergens (Fig. 1 ). This hypothesis implies that factors in the environment can determine the initiation of allergic sensitization and can potentially influence the clinical manifestations and severity of disease. Because the prevalence of atopic diseases such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, and food allergy have increased worldwide in the,past several decades, and there is no mechanism for changes in population genetics over this short period of time, changes in the human environment are most likely responsible for these trends. From this line of reasoning, it follows that if the factors responsible for the increasing prevalence can be identified, then there would be an opportunity to develop strategies to reverse these trends. It also would be helpful to identify infants who are at risk for developing allergy, so that preventive strategies could be used most effectively. In this article, studies to determine the contributions of genetics and the environment to the development of allergic, diseases in childhood are explored. In addition, progress in identifying risk factors for allergy and preventive therapies for those children at risk are also addressed.

These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre remains active. Sensitization to 1 or more of the common indoor allergens has been consistently associated with asthma among children and young adults (odds ratios for asthma, 3-18). For dust mite and cockroach allergens, there is a dose response relationship between domestic exposure and sensitization. Given that allergen provocation can induce many of the features of asthma, the findings strongly suggest that there is a causal relationship between allergen exposure in the home and asthma. However, it remains unclear at what time the critical exposure occurs (ie, in infancy or later) and what role allergen exposure has played in the increasing prevalence and severity of asthma. Objective evidence of an immune response to allergens is generally not present until after 2 years of age. Viral infections play several different roles in asthma in childhood. In infancy, respiratory syncytial virus infection can induce bronchiolitis and set up recurrent wheezing over the next few years. However, the risk factors for this are maternal smoking and small lungs at birth, rather than allergy. By contrast, the role of rhinovirus in precipitating attacks in children and young adults is strongly associated with allergy. Thus the likely scenario is that allergen exposure over the first few years of life induces sensitization (ie, T H2 cells and IgE antibodies). Continuing exposure can maintain inflammation in the nose and lungs. However, many other factors contribute to wheezing such that there is no simple relationship between allergen exposure and asthma. Nonetheless, it is clear that the changes that have increased asthma have acted on allergic children.

{"text":"Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) are at risk of serious influenza-related complications. The impact of respiratory co-infection in SOTR with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) is unknown. A multicentre prospective study of consecutive cases of pandemic influenza A(H1N1) in SOTR was carried out to assess the clinical characteristics and outcome and the risk factors for co-infection. Overall, 51 patients were included. Median time from transplant was 3.7 years, 5.9% of the cases occurred perioperatively and 7.8% were hospitalacquired. Pneumonia was diagnosed in 15 (29.4%) patients. Ten cases were severe (19.6%): 13.7% were admitted to intensive care units, 5.9% suffered septic shock, 5.9% developed acute graft rejection and 7.8% died. Co-infection was detected in 15 patients (29.4%): eight viral, six bacterial and one fungal. Viral co-infection did not affect the outcome. Patients with non-viral co-infection had a worse outcome: longer hospital stay (26.2 \u00b1 20.7 vs. 5.5 \u00b1 10.2) and higher rate of severe diseases (85.7% vs. 2.3%) and mortality (42.8% vs. 2.3%). Independent risk factors for non-viral co-infection were: diabetes mellitus and septic shock. Other factors associated with severe influenza were: delayed antiviral therapy, diabetes mellitus, time since transplantation <90 days and pneumonia. In conclusion, pandemic influenza A can cause significant direct and indirect effects in SOTR, especially in the early post-transplant period, and should be treated early. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of non-viral co-infection, mainly in diabetic patients and severe cases.

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study on exposed HCWs from August 2016 to January 2018 at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Demographic factors and TB exposure episodes per HCW were obtained. A modified Poisson regression model was used to identify factors associated with TB infection. Results: A total of 32 TB exposure events occurred during the study period. A total of 881 HCWs with 1,536 exposure episodes were screened with QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-tube assay (QFT-GIT) at baseline and 8 weeks. A total of 129 (14.6%) HCWs had positive QFT-TB at baseline, whereas 22 (2.5%) HCWs had QFT-GIT conversion, with a latent TB infection (LTBI) rate of 1.14 cases per 100 exposure episodes per year. Foreign nationality, non-Chinese ethnicity, and age above 40 years were independently associated with baseline LTBI, whereas having >2 TB exposure episodes and working in internal medicine, medical subspecialties, and psychiatry wards were associated with QFT-GIT conversion. Discussion: The QFT-GIT conversion rate among screened HCWs is low. Foreign HCWs with LTBI likely came from countries with higher TB transmission. Targeted prevention of repeated TB exposures can reduce QFT-GIT conversion. Conclusions: The study results will guide TB contact tracing protocols in health care institutions.","meta":{"paper_id":"db1f2e3f0b16df42a30f5bbb6b7508127a05de1f","title":"A retrospective review of tuberculosis exposure among health care workers in a tertiary hospital"}}

Serological screening was carried out on 303 samples from animals slaughtered between 2005 and 2008, and random-effect logistic regression models were developed for pathogens with a 'non-zero' prevalence. The apparent animal prevalence for PPV, PCV2, and L. intracellularis was 46.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 41-52%), 51.1% (95% CI 45-57%) and 59.2% (95% CI 54-65%), respectively.

No antibodies were detected against SIV, ADV, CSFV, SVDV, TGEV, PRSSV, Leptospira spp., Brucella spp., or M. hyopneumoniae. Increasing herd size, proximity to dense populations of domestic swine and later sampling times within the survey period were found to be risk factors. Overall, the seroprevalence of these pathogens in farmed wild boar was similar to that in the farmed domestic pig population in Finland.

Methods: We prospectively evaluated 181 infants with severe bronchiolitis admitted at three hospitals over a 2year period, who required oxygen therapy. The control group consisted of 536 healthy adults. Patients were evaluated for the presence of comorbidities (premature birth, chronic respiratory disease, and congenital heart disease), underwent nasopharyngeal aspirate testing for virus detection by multiplex-PCR, and SNPs identification in immune response genes.

{"text":"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been widely applied to identify genetic factors that affect complex diseases or traits. Presently, the GWAS Catalog includes > 2800 human studies. Of these, only a minority have investigated the susceptibility to infectious diseases or the response to therapies for the treatment or prevention of infections. Despite their limited application in the field, GWASs have provided valuable insights by pinpointing associations to both innate and adaptive immune response loci, as well as novel unexpected risk factors for infection susceptibility. Herein, we discuss some issues and caveats of GWASs for infectious diseases, we review the most recent findings ensuing from these studies, and we provide a brief summary of selected GWASs for infections in non-human mammals. We conclude that, although the general trend in the field of complex traits is to shift from GWAS to next-generation sequencing, important knowledge on infectious diseaserelated traits can be still gained by GWASs, especially for those conditions that have never been investigated using this approach. We suggest that future studies will benefit from the leveraging of information from the host's and pathogen's genomes, as well as from the exploration of models that incorporate heterogeneity across populations and phenotypes. Interactions within HLA genes or among HLA variants and polymorphisms located outside the major histocompatibility complex may also play an important role in shaping the susceptibility and response to invading pathogens.","meta":{"paper_id":"8388a6b2a13edf94c16b7cc931aba71223de0dcf","title":"Genetic susceptibility to infectious diseases: Current status and future perspectives from genome-wide approaches"}}

The management relies on empirical therapy, which takes into account the severity of the infectious episode, the presence of additional risk factors, comorbidities and institutionalization. #","meta":{"paper_id":"3ad03a959ecb59a71520810bcbfe6083ed0cd7fb","title":"Caract\u00e9ristiques des infections respiratoires basses chez les sujets \u00e2g\u00e9s Characteristics of lower respiratory tract infections in the elderly"}}
{"text":"KEYWORDS Cox proportional hazard model; dentist; mortality; standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) Background\/Purpose: Controversy exists in the literature regarding whether dentists with multiple occupational exposures suffer from premature mortality. A cohort mortality study was conducted to evaluate the survival outcome and determine if potential exposure to harmful agents leads to premature mortality among dentists. Methods: Using the Life Table Analysis System, we calculated standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for a cohort of 11,700 dentists affiliated with the Taiwan Dental Association. These dentists were followed from 1985e2009. Reference rates were derived from cause-, gender-, and age-specific mortality rates of the general population of Taiwan and 18,664 Taiwanese internists, who were considered to be more socioeconomically proximal to dentists. A Cox proportional hazard model was also constructed to determine multiple risk factors associated with mortality. Results: Compared with the general population, dentists in Taiwan consistently demonstrated reduced from all-cause mortality. However, compared with internists, significant and excess mortality were observed in dentists for overall mortality (SMR Z 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] Z 1.00 e1.26), drowning (SMR Z 6.62; 95% CI Z 2.15 e15.45), and heart diseases (SMR Z 1.66; 95% CI Z 1.22e2.21). After adjusting for other risk factors, the Cox model showed an increased hazard ratio of 1.17 (95% CI Z 1.01e1.37) for dentists. Conclusion: Taiwanese dentists demonstrated significant elevated SMRs for overall causes, drowning, and heart diseases. Careful precaution should be taken to reduce these trends. Future studies are also needed for in-depth exploration of the mechanisms regarding how professional stress and exposure contribute to the increased risk of mortality in Taiwanese dentists.","meta":{"paper_id":"4e9fd8d4bd375552ee024e94b1484664d3932c67","title":"Mortality among dentists in Taiwan, 1985e2009"}}
{"text":"RATIONALE: In infancy, rhinovirus illnesses and severe RSV bronchiolitis indicate increased risk for recurrent wheezing and asthma, but there is less information about other viruses. We evaluated the frequency and severity of metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronavirus (HCV) infections in a high-risk group of infants. METHODS: Nasal lavage samples were obtained in the first year of life during scheduled study visits and symptomatic respiratory illnesses as part of the Childhood Origins of Asthma Project (COAST). Samples (n 5 567) were analyzed by Respiratory Multicode Assay (RMA) for HMPV, HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-SARS. RESULTS: HMPV was isolated in 10.7% of samples during illnesses (n 5 291), and also occurred with other respiratory viruses (4.8%). 47.8% of HMPV illnesses included wheezing. HCV were isolated in 19.2% of the samples during illnesses and included HCV-OC43 (10.0%) and HCV-NL63 (9.6%). In addition, HCV was commonly detected together with other respiratory viruses (6.5%). Of all HCV illnesses (n 5 42), 33.3% included wheezing; however, HCV-NL63 had a significantly higher wheezing rate compared to HCV-OC43 (37.5% vs. 4.5%, p 5 0.028). Children who had at least one HCV-NL63 illness during infancy were significantly more likely to have asthma at age 6 compared to those without HCV-NL63 illnesses (52.2% vs. 25.0%, p 5 0.007). Having either HCV-OC43 or HMPV was not a risk factor for asthma at age 6. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in viral diagnostics has allowed for identification of viruses that are difficult to culture. In infancy, HCV-NL63, HCV-OC43 and HMPV were significant causes of wheezing illnesses, however, only HCV-NL63 was significantly associated with asthma development at age six.","meta":{"paper_id":"1c406ea14d2e344812f28f1c17cc8bcace7fda3f","title":"574 Coronavirus NL63 Illnesses in Infancy are a Risk Factor for Asthma at Age Six 575 Seasonal Distribution Of Respiratory Viruses In Pediatric"}}

CAP is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases and the sixth-ranked cause of death overall in the United States [1]. It is estimated that 4 to 5 million cases of CAP occur annually, accounting for approximately 10 million physician visits, 500,000 hospitalizations, 45,000 deaths, and an annual cost of $23 billion [2,3].

{"text":"Objective To investigate the risk factors of empyema after acute viral infection and to clarify the hypothesized association(s) between empyema and some viruses and\/or the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). A case-control study was conducted in 15 centers. Cases and controls were enrolled for a source population of children 3-15 years of age with acute viral infections between 2006 and 2009. Results Among 215 empyemas, 83 cases (children with empyema and acute viral infection within the 15 preceding days) were included, and 83 controls (children with acute viral infection) were matched to cases. Considering the intake of any drug within 72 hours after acute viral infection onset and at least 6 consecutive days of antibiotic use and at least 1 day of NSAIDs exposure, the multivariable analysis retained an increased risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure (aOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.4-5.58, P = .004), and a decreased risk associated with antibiotic use (aOR 0.32, 95% CI 0.11-0.97, P = .04). The risk of empyema associated with NSAIDs exposure was greater for children not prescribed an antibiotic and antibiotic intake diminished that risk for children given NSAIDs. Conclusions NSAIDs use during acute viral infection is associated with an increased risk of empyema in children, and antibiotics are associated with a decreased risk. The presence of antibiotic-NSAIDs interaction with this risk is suggested. These findings suggest that NSAIDs should not be recommended as a first-line antipyretic treatment during acute viral infections in children.

{"text":"Background: Viral respiratory tract infections and atopy are associated with attacks of wheezing during childhood. However, information about the relationship between viral infections and atopy among children whose attacks of wheezing lead to hospitalization is unclear. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of viral respiratory tract pathogens among infants and children hospitalized for wheezing and to analyze the results in relation to the patient's age, atopic characteristics, and season of admission. Methods: This was a case-control study of children (age 2 months to 18 years) admitted for wheezing to the University of Virginia Medical Center over a period of 12 months. Children without wheezing were enrolled as controls. Nasal secretions were evaluated for viral pathogens by using cultures, PCR tests, and antigen detection. Total IgE and specific IgE antibody to common aeroallergens was measured in serum. Results: Seventy percent of children hospitalized for wheezing before age 3 years (n = 79) were admitted between December and March, whereas 46% of children age 3 to 18 years (n = 54) were hospitalized between September and November. Among children younger than 3 years, viral pathogens were detected in 84% (66\/79) of wheezing children and 55% (42\/77) of controls (P < .001). Respiratory syncytial virus was the dominant pathogen during the winter months, but rhinovirus was more common during other months. Total serum IgE levels were generally low, and values from wheezing and control subjects overlapped considerably. Among children 3 years and older, 61% (33\/54) of subjects admitted for wheezing tested positive for virus (predominantly rhinovirus), compared with 21% (12\/ 56) of controls (P < .001). The total serum IgE values among wheezing children (geometric mean, 386 IU\/mL; 95% CI, 259-573) were substantially elevated compared with those of controls (geometric mean, 38 IU\/mL; 95% CI, 26-56; P < .001). A significantly higher percentage of wheezing children compared with controls was sensitized to at least 1 of the inhaled allergens tested: 84% (36\/43) compared with 33% (15\/ 45; P < .001). The atopic characteristics of wheezing children who tested positive or negative for virus were similar. Conclusions: Viral infections were the dominant risk factor for wheezing among children hospitalized before 3 years of age. By comparison, a large majority of the wheezing children age 3 to 18 years had striking atopic characteristics that may be critical as a risk factor for hospitalization and an adverse response to viral infections, especially infections caused by rhinovirus.","meta":{"paper_id":"2f739ce158fe0605ca31cd2b83e00abfba4c6823","title":"Viral infections in relation to age, atopy, and season of admission among children hospitalized for wheezing"}}
{"text":"EBV is a key risk factor for many malignancy diseases such as nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL). EBV integration has been reported, but its scale and impact to cancer development is remains unclear. C666-1 (NPC cell line) and Raji (BL cell line) are commonly studied EBV-positive cancer cells. A rare few EBV integration sites in Raji were found in previous research by traditional methods. To deeply survey EBV integration, we sequenced C666-1 and Raji whole genomes by the next generation sequencing (NGS) technology and a total of 909 breakpoints were detected in the two cell lines. Moreover, we observed that the number of integration sites was positive correlated with the total amount of chromosome structural variations (SVs) and copy number structural variations (CNVs), and most breakpoints located inside or nearby genome structural variations regions. It suggested that host genome instability provided an opportunity for EBV integration on one hand and the integration aggravated host genome instability on the other hand. Then, we respectively assembled the C666-1 and Raji EBV strains which would be useful resources for EBV-relative studies. Thus, we report the most comprehensive characterization of EBV integration in NPC cell and BL cell, and EBV shows the wide range and random integration to increase the tumorigenesis. The NGS provides an incomparable level of resolution on EBV integration and a convenient approach to obtain viral strain compared to any research technology before.","meta":{"paper_id":"6658283efba628db14a76984b7d3f39d79712f4c","title":"Genome-wide Analysis of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Integration and Strain in C666-1 and Raji Cells"}}

During April 2011eApril 2012, we conducted a cross-sectional survey on home environment and childhood health and collected 13,335 parents-reported questionnaires of 4e6 year-old children in Shanghai, China. In this paper, we investigated associations between the incidence and duration of common colds among these children during the past 12 months before the survey and frequency of opening windows, as well as household dampness-related exposures (indicated by six dampness indicators). Significantly higher incidence (!3 times) and longer duration (!2 weeks) of common cold were found among children with than without these dampness exposures (p-value <0.01 for mold spots and p-value <0.001 for all other indicators). The number of dampness-related indicators had a positive and strong dose-response relationship with common colds (p-trend <0.01). Low frequency of ventilation was also a risk factor for children common colds. After adjusted for the potential confounders in the multiple logistic regression analyses, all dampness-related indicators were significantly associated with the increased odds of common colds and the highest odds ratios was 1.21 (95% CI: 1.16e1.27). We also found that dampness-related exposures and household ventilation habits (p-value for interaction <0.001) had a strong interaction effect on the incidence and duration of common cold.

To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates. We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years. Findings In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286-873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65\u00b74% decrease, 61\u00b75-68\u00b75) and in mortality rate (from 362\u00b77 deaths [330\u00b71-392\u00b70] per 100 000 children to 118\u00b79 deaths [109\u00b78-128\u00b73] per 100 000 children; 67\u00b72% decrease, 63\u00b75-70\u00b71). LRI incidence declined globally (32\u00b74% decrease, 27\u00b72-37\u00b75). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11\u00b74% decrease, 0\u00b70-24\u00b75), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6\u00b73% decrease, 6\u00b71-6\u00b73), and reductions in household air pollution (8\u00b74%, 6\u00b78-9\u00b72). Interpretation Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

{"text":"We describe a pilot study that attempted to infect human volunteers with Cyclospora cayetanensis. Seven healthy volunteers ingested an inoculum of Cyclospora oocysts (approximately 200-49,000 oocysts). The volunteers did not experience symptoms of gastroenteritis, and no oocysts were detected in any stool samples during the 16 weeks volunteers were monitored. C yclospora cayetanensis is a protozoan parasite that may cause gastroenteritis with prolonged, intermittent diarrhea in humans. Characterization and magnitudes of risk factors associated with food and water consumption are unclear because the dose-response relationship and other host-parasite factors for infection with Cyclospora are unknown. To characterize infectivity, we performed a study in which inocula of Cyclospora oocysts were administered to human volunteers. Stool samples containing high concentrations of Cyclospora oocysts and serum specimens were collected from persons with cyclosporiasis in Haiti and the United States. Informed consent was obtained from persons providing the specimens. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) institutional review board (IRB) reviewed specimen collection, informed consent, and patient counseling procedures. Stool specimens were homogenized with water and sieved through cheesecloth. Since Cyclospora oocysts must form sporocysts outside the human host before becoming infectious, the filtrate was resuspended in potassium dichromate (2.5%) and shaken for about 3 weeks at room temperature to induce sporulation. After sporulation (67%-94% of oocysts sporulated), samples were stored at room temperature until further processing (2-3 months).

{"text":"Bovine torovirus (BToV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, is an established gastrointestinal infectious agent in cattle. No epidemiological research on BToV has been reported from Japan. In this study, we performed a survey to detect BToV in Japan in 2004 and 2005 using 231 fecal samples (167 from diarrheic cattle and 64 from asymptomatic cattle) that were analyzed by nested reverse transcription (RT) PCR using primers located in the consensus sequences of the reported BToV nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes. BToV N, M, and S genes were detected in 6.5% (15\/231), 6.1% (14\/231), and 5.6% (13\/231) of samples by nested-RT-PCR, respectively. In conclusion, detectability was improved compared to the results of the first round of RT-PCR. BToV was detected at a significantly higher rate in diarrheic samples than in asymptomatic samples (14\/167 diarrheic samples [8.4%] and 1\/64 asymptomatic samples [1.6%]), suggesting that BToV may act as a risk factor for diarrhea in Japanese cattle. The nucleotide sequence of M fragments from the BToV isolates including the newly identified Japanese isolates showed more than 97% identity. A similar degree of homology was observed in the N gene fragment among BToV isolates with the exception of BRV-1 and BRV-2. Domestic samples were classified into three clusters by phylogenetic analysis of the S gene fragment, which were considerably correlated with the geographic origin of the samples. BToV positive areas did not adjoin each other but were spread across a wide range, suggesting that BToV exists conventionally in Japan and is geographically differentiated. We also developed an RFLP method to distinguish these clusters using two restriction enzymes, HaeIII and AccI. This method should be useful for comparing newly acquired BToV-positive samples with the reported BToVs.","meta":{"paper_id":"5105971a345abc7240ae41207d785375a298a50d","title":"Epidemiological analysis of bovine torovirus in Japan"}}

{"text":"Concern from the public is growing regarding early cow-calf separation, yet proponents of this practice maintain that artificial rearing is critical for cow and calf health. Early separation is assumed to reduce the risk of transfer of pathogens from dam to neonatal calf, but a wide range of health benefits associated with extended cow-calf contact has also been documented. The aim of this systematic review was to report and synthesize conclusions from the literature on dairy cow and calf health in conventional rearing versus cow-calf contact systems. Peer-reviewed, published manuscripts, written in English, directly comparing dairy cow or calf health in artificial versus suckling systems, were eligible for inclusion. We conducted 7 targeted searches using Web of Science to identify key literature on important health conditions. The resulting manuscripts underwent a 4-step appraisal process, and further manuscripts were sourced from reference lists. This process resulted in a final sample of 70 articles that addressed cow and calf health. Sufficient literature was available to assess mastitis in cows, and scours, cryptosporidiosis, Johne's disease, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality in calves. The results for cryptosporidiosis, pneumonia, immunity, and mortality were mixed, with some differences between studies likely attributable to flawed comparisons between cohorts. Overall, the articles addressing calf scours and mastitis pointed to beneficial or no effects of suckling. The studies addressing Johne's disease did not find cow-calf contact to be a significant risk factor. In conclusion, the scientific peer-reviewed literature on cow and calf health provides no consistent evidence in support of early separation.","meta":{"paper_id":"c8f78a9126bf9f6e7304de755a1c0f6693e4a3d0","title":"INVITED REVIEW: HEALTH EFFECTS OF EARLY SEPARATION 5786 BEAVER ET AL"}}

{"text":"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) possesses characteristics that render it particularly prone to stigmatization. SARS-related stigma, despite its salience for public health and stigma research, has had little examination. This study combines survey and case study methods to examine subjective stigma among residents of Amoy Gardens (AG), the first officially recognized site of community outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong. A total of 903 residents of AG completed a self-report questionnaire derived from two focus groups conducted toward the end of the 3-month outbreak. Case studies of two residents who lived in Block E, the heart of the SARS epidemic at AG, complement the survey data. Findings show that stigma affected most residents and took various forms of being shunned, insulted, marginalized, and rejected in the domains of work, interpersonal relationships, use of services and schooling. Stigma was also associated with psychosomatic distress. Residents' strategies for diminishing stigma varied with gender, age, education, occupation, and proximity to perceived risk factors for SARS such as residential location, previous SARS infection and the presence of ex-SARS household members. Residents attributed stigma to government mismanagement, contagiousness of the mysterious SARS virus, and alarmist media reporting. Stigma clearly decreased, but never completely disappeared, after the outbreak. The findings confirm and add to existing knowledge on the varied origins, correlates, and impacts of stigma. They also highlight the synergistic roles of inconsistent health policy responses and risk miscommunication by the media in rapidly amplifying stigma toward an unfamiliar illness. While recognizing the intrinsically stigmatizing nature of public health measures to control SARS, we recommend that a consistent inter-sectoral approach is needed to minimize stigma and to make an effective health response to future outbreaks. r","meta":{"paper_id":"248470bd32929e3290b0a5742bffc266cdc5622b","title":"The experience of SARS-related stigma at Amoy Gardens"}}

{"text":"Objective:To explore the epidemiology and etiology for an outbreak of acute respiratory tract infection that occurred in one county of Jiangsu Province, China 2004. Methods: Only cases meeting the case definition were included in the study. We reviewed the medical records of the cases who were admitted to the local hospitals, interviewed cases by a standard questionnaire, and then described the epidemiologic features and analyzed risk factors by means of a case-control study. We collected pharyngeal swab specimens and sent them to different laboratories for isolation and culture. The laboratory used different detection methods such as DIF, PCR, electron microscope examination and microneutralization assay, to identify and then type the positive specimens. Results:A total of 871 cases were reported during the period from April 18 to July 4, 2004. The distribution of onset times presented two peaks, one in late May and another in middle June. The epidemic occurred mainly in the elementary and junior high schools in ten townships of one county, and the mean age of the cases was 12 years (range 7 months to 18 years). The course of the disease was acute, and was characterized by fever accompanied with sore throat and tonsillitis. The WBC count of cases was normal or elevated. The mean duration of illness was 5 days (range 2 to 12 days). No fatalities from illness were reported. A case-control study indicated that the possible risk factors were close contact with a case and\/or poultry before onset and sharing of towels among members of the family. The typical CPE was observed through inoculating pharyngeal swab specimens into the HEP-2 cell cultures in different laboratories. An infection of adenovirus type 3 was verified by detecting positive specimens in different methods. Conclusion:This investigation demonstrated that the acute respiratory infection in cases was caused by adenovirus type 3. Cases occurred in over 70 schools in ten townships in 2004, and the route of transmission was possibly close contact with cases or droplet transmission.","meta":{"paper_id":"4940630ef0d7fedb1071bd36b1290bfa20ad28e7","title":"Possible Spread of adenovirus type 3 from poultry to humans: indirect evidence from an outbreak in China"}}

{"text":"To assess the rapidly changing psychological status of nurses during the acute phase of the 2003 SARS outbreak, we conducted a prospective and periodic evaluation of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation among nurses in SARS units and non-SARS units. Nurse participants were from two SARS units (regular SARS [N = 44] and SARS ICU [N = 26]) and two non-SARS units (Neurology [N = 15] and CCU [N = 17]). Participants periodically self-evaluated their depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress symptoms, sleep disturbance, attitude towards SARS and family support. Results showed that depression (38.5% vs. 3.1%) and insomnia (37% vs. 9.7%) were, respectively, greater in the SARS unit nurses than the non-SARS unit nurses. No difference between these two groups was found in the prevalence of post-traumatic stress symptoms (33% vs. 18.7%), yet, three unit subjects (SARS ICU, SARS regular and Neurology) had significantly higher rate than those in CCU (29.7% vs. 11.8%, respectively) (p < 0.05). For the SARS unit nurses, significant reduction in mood ratings, insomnia rate and perceived negative feelings as well as increasing knowledge and understanding of SARS at the end of the study (all p < 0.001) indicated that a gradual psychological adaptation had occurred. The adjustment of nurses in the more structured SARS ICU environment, where nurses care for even more severely ill patients, may have been as good or better than that of nurses in the regular SARS unit. Occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was linked to direct exposure to SARS patient care, previous mood disorder history, younger age and perceived negative feelings. Positive coping attitude and strong social and family support may have protected against acute stress. In conclusion, the psychological impact on the caring staffs facing future bio-disaster will be minimized with lowered risk factors and a safer and more structured work environment.","meta":{"paper_id":"b0987d9c6c5278a01841398509512aafa1ca8e14","title":"Prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and psychological adaptation of the nurses in a structured SARS caring unit during outbreak: A prospective and periodic assessment study in Taiwan q"}}

According to the World Health Organization, it is currently the sixth leading cause of death in the world, and further increases in the prevalence and mortality of the disease is predicted for the coming decades. These increases are mainly linked to the epidemic of tobacco exposure and indoor and outdoor air pollution in Asian countries. The burden of COPD in Asia is currently greater than that in developed Western countries, both in terms of the total number of deaths and the burden of disease, as measured in years of life lost and years spent living with disability. The types of health-care policies and the practice of medicine vary considerably among the regions of Asia and have an impact on the burden of disease. Treatment aims in Asian countries are based on evidence-based management guidelines. Barriers to the implementation of disease management guidelines are related to issues of resource conflict and lack of organizational support rather than cultural differences in medical practice. To reduce this burden of COPD in Asian countries, there is a need for a multifaceted approach in improving awareness of prevalence and disease burden, in facilitating accurate diagnosis of COPD among chronic respiratory diseases, in championing health policies that reduce the burden of the main risk factors for COPD and in the wider use of evidence-based management for COPD.

Methods We are presenting the clinical course of infection (E. rhusiopathiae) and discuss clinical forms. E. rhusiopathiae in humans may have the following clinical course: mild form of skin infection diagnosed as local erythema (erysipeloid), disseminated form of skin infection and the most serious form of infection of systemic course (endocarditis and sepsis). Mild skin infection and local erythema are the most common forms. Very rare case of animal-borne infection course has been presented in which after initial phase the disease was generalised to the abscesses formation in paravertebral space, spondylitis and empyema formation in spinal canal. In the presented clinical case, the patient was suffering from diabetes. It was probably an additional risk factor of the disease generalisation. Patient underwent drainage of empyema in spinal canal, after which his neurological status gradually improved. Antibiotic therapy was implemented and continued for 8 weeks. Such course of erysipelas was not previously described in the literature. After therapy neurological status was improved.

Valid responses were obtained for 57,300 vaccinated dogs at 573 animal hospitals; we obtained VAAEs information for last 100 vaccinated dogs in each veterinary hospital. We found that of the 57,300, 359 dogs showed VAAEs. Of the 359 dogs, death was observed in 1, anaphylaxis in 41, dermatological signs in 244, gastrointestinal signs in 160, and other signs in 106. Onset of VAAEs was mostly observed within 12 h after vaccination (n = 299, 83.3%). In this study, anaphylaxis events occurred within 60 min after vaccination, and about half of these events occurred within 5 min (n = 19, 46.3%). Furthermore, where anaphylaxis was reported, additional information to support the diagnosis was obtained by reinvestigation. Our resurvey of dogs with anaphylaxis yielded responses on 31 dogs; 27 of these demonstrated collapse (87.1%), 24 demonstrated cyanosis (77.4%), and both signs occurred in 22 (71.0%). Higher rates of animal VAAEs, anaphylaxis, and death were found in Japan than in other countries. Further investigations, including survey studies, will be necessary to elucidate the interaction between death and vaccination and the risk factors for VAAEs, and thus develop safer vaccines.

{"text":"Viral infections in infancy, particularly with rhinovirus (RV) or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), are important risk factors for wheezing episodes, asthma, and asthma exacerbations. RV infection is a more important risk factor for the development of atopic asthma, likely through a mechanism that relies on allergic sensitization. RSV infection is a more important risk factor for the development of nonatopic asthma, likely through a different mechanism than RV. Neutrophils and dendritic cell responses to viral infection appear to be important contributors to the T H 2 response that defines atopic asthma. Understanding the association among viral infections, atopy, and asthma can help guide appropriate treatment strategies for viralinduced or exacerbated asthma. Objective: To synthesize available data related to the complex associations among viral infections, atopy, and asthma. Data Sources: Key historical articles, articles highlighted in our recent review of most significant recent asthma advancements, and findings from several birth cohorts related to asthma and viral infections were reviewed. In addition, PubMed was searched for review articles and original research related to the associations between viral infection and asthma, using the search words asthma, viral infections, atopy, development of asthma, rhinovirus (RV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Study Selections: Articles were selected based on novelty and relevance to our topic of interest, the role of asthma and viral infections, and possible mechanisms to explain the association. Results: There is a large body of evidence demonstrating a link between early viral infections (especially RV and RSV) and asthma inception and exacerbations. RV-induced wheezing is an important risk factor for asthma only when atopy is present, with much evidence supporting the idea that sensitization is a risk factor for early RV-induced wheezing, which in turn is a risk factor for asthma. RSV, on the other hand, is a more important risk factor for nonatopic asthma, with severe infections conferring greater risk. Conclusion: There are important differences in the development of atopic and nonatopic asthma, with several proposed mechanisms explaining the association between viral infections and the development of asthma and asthma exacerbations. Understanding these complex associations is important for developing asthma prevention strategies and targeted asthma therapies.","meta":{"paper_id":"e6a2d360c66488cd0e599c35b73ed8dcf4eb3077","title":"Asthma and viral infections An intricate relationship A R T I C L E I N F O"}}

{"text":"The aim of this study was to identify possible risk factors for 1-90 day calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds. Sixty herds with a herd size of \u2265160 cows were visited once between December 2005 and March 2006. Thirty herds were known to have low mortality (LM) and 30 were known high mortality herds (HM). Upon the visit, data about housing and management was collected from interviews with personnel responsible for the calves. The herd status regarding the calves' passive transfer (total protein), levels of \u2423-tocopherol, \u2424-carotene and retinol, and excretion of faecal pathogens (Cryptosporidium spp., Escherichia coli F5, rota and corona virus) was evaluated based on targeted sampling of high risk calf groups; in each herd, blood and faecal samples were collected from calves 1-7 and 1-14 days old, respectively. Similarly, the herd status regarding clinical respiratory disease in calves and history of respiratory virus exposure was evaluated based on lung auscultations and blood samplings of calves 60-90 days old. The median calf mortality risk (in calves 1-90 days of age) among HM herds was 9% (Range: 6-24%) and among LM herds 1% (Range: 0-2%). LM and HM herds were compared using five logistic regression models, covering potential risk factors within different areas: \"Disease susceptibility\", \"Factors affecting the gastrointestinal tract\", \"Factors related to transmission of infectious disease\", \"Hygiene\" and \"Labour management\". The percentage of calves, 1-7 days old, with inadequate serum concentrations of \u2423-tocopherol and \u2424-carotene were significantly higher in HM herds compared to LM herds and also associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.02; p = 0.023 and OR = 1.05; p = 0.0028, respectively). The variable \"Average number of faecal pathogens in the sampled target group\" was significantly associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 4.65; p = 0.015), with a higher average in HM herds. The percentage of calves with diarrhoea treated with antibiotics was significantly higher in HM herds and was associated with higher odds of being a HM herd (OR = 1.08; p = 0.021). The median age at death of calves in the age interval 1-90 days that died during a oneyear period was significantly lower among HM herds (13 days) than in LM herds (24 days) (p = 0.0013) The results indicate that gastrointestinal disorders may be an important cause of calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds. Furthermore, our study provides additional indications that fat soluble vitamins might play an important role for calf health.","meta":{"paper_id":"ab77b7faa3d2ca4577c472c8bcdeecbfe6c0373d","title":"Risk factors for calf mortality in large Swedish dairy herds"}}

{"text":"Glucocorticoid (GC) usage is the most common non-traumatic cause of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ON). Despite the strong association of GC with ON, the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. Investigators have proposed both direct and indirect effects of GC on cells. Indirect and direct mechanisms remain intimately related and often result in positive feedback loops to potentiate the disease processes. However, the direct effects, in particular apoptosis, have recently been shown to be increasingly important. Suppression of osteoblast and osteoclast precursor production, increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes, prolongation of the lifespan of osteoclasts and apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC) are all direct effects of GC usage. Elevated blood pressure through several pathways may raise the risk of clot formation. High-dose GC also decreases tissue plasminogen activator activity (t-PA) and increases plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) antigen levels increasing the procoagulant potential of GC. Inhibited angiogenesis, altered bone repair and nitric oxide metabolism can also result. Also, GC treatment modulates other vasoactive mediators such as endothelin-1, noradrenalin and bradykinin. Thus, GCs act as a regulator of local blood flow by modulating vascular responsiveness to vasoactive substances. Vasoconstriction induced in intraosseous femoral head arteries causes femoral head ischemia. GCs also cause ischemia through increased intraosseous pressure, which subsequently decreases the blood flow to the femoral head by apoptosis of ECs as well as elevating the level of adipogenesis and fat hypertrophy in the bone marrow. It is difficult to predict which patients receiving a specific dose of GC will develop ON, indicating individual differences in steroid sensitivity and the potential of additional mechanisms. The textbook model of ON is a multiple hit theory in which, with a greater number of risk factors, the risk of ON increases. While more effort is needed to better comprehend the role of GC in ON, newer data on GC action upon the endothelial cell and the regional endothelial bed dysfunction theory sheds new light on particular GC mechanisms. Better understanding of GC pathomechanisms can lead to better treatment options.","meta":{"paper_id":"948fb2ddb1a1541d7fe2aa9e750e2fb70e0ffdd7","title":"Mini review Glucocorticoids in osteonecrosis of the femoral head: A new understanding of the mechanisms of action"}}

To assess the risk of delayed management of TB, we analyzed the risk factors of prolonged delay in isolation of smear-positive TB patients in pulmonology\/infectious diseases and other wards in a tertiary teaching hospital. Methods: We enrolled smear-positive TB patients aged > 16 years with delayed respiratory isolation following hospitalization. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Time intervals between admission, order of sputum acid-fast staining, initiation of anti-tuberculous treatment and isolation were compared between pulmonology\/infectious diseases wards (PIWs) and other wards. Risk factors were analyzed in patients with prolonged isolation delay of > 7 days in individual groups. Results: Isolation was delayed in 191 (73.7%) of 259 hospitalized smear-positive TB patients.

{"text":"Serolo,Eical screening of swine herds in 1984indicated that porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) had been introduced into Denmark. To determine risk factors associated with the introduction of PRCV, a cross-sectional study of 408 Danish swine herds was carried out between May 1985 and June 1986. The association between herd-PRCV serological status and possible risk factors, obtained from a field questionnaire, was assessed by unconditional maximum likelihood logistic regression. An increasing herd size, location in the Jutland peninsula (compared with location on the island of Funen) (OR = 7.9 in a multivariable logistic regression model not including interaction terms), the presence of a slurry system (i.e. pigs living on a slatted floor) (OR=4.6) and purchase of pigs (OR= 1.7) were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with seropositivity. Two significant interactions, both involving herd s#ize, were subsequently identified. The PF!CV serological status of neighbouring herds was found to be related, and closeness of a seropositive herd was associated with an increased risk of a herd being serologically positive. The re.sults of this study indicate that herd size may be an important determinant of airborne transmission of PRCV infection, and that herd size may modify the effect of other risk factors. *Corresponding author. 0167-5877\/95\/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

{"text":"Advanced age is a risk factor of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. To understand its pathogenesis, we developed an animal model using BALB\/c mice and the mouse-passaged Frankfurt 1 isolate of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We examined the immune responses to SARS-CoV in both young and adult mice. SARS-CoV induced severe respiratory illness in all adult, but not young, mice on day 2 after inoculation with a mortality rate of 30 to 50%. Moribund adult mice showed severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage accompanied by virus replication. Adult murine lungs, which had significantly higher interleukin (IL)-4 and lower IL-10 and IL-13 levels before infection than young murine lungs, rapidly produced high levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines known to induce macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and activation (eg , tumor necrosis factor-\u2423). On day 2 after inoculation , young murine lungs produced not only proinflammatory cytokines but also IL-2 , interferon-\u2425 , IL-10 , and IL-13. Adult mice showed early and acute excessive proinflammatory responses (ie , cytokine storm) in the lungs after SARS-CoV infection , which led to severe pulmonary edema and diffuse alveolar damage. Intravenous injection with anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u2423 antibody 3 hours after infection had no effect on SARS-CoV infection. However , intraperitoneal interferon-\u2425 injection protected adult mice from the lethal respiratory illness. The experimental model described here may be useful for elucidating the pathophysiology of SARS and for evaluating therapies to treat SARS-CoV infection.","meta":{"paper_id":"2adbfa1b4f6dacb2a5b2f6d02632c30929dd613d","title":"Mouse-Passaged Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Associated Coronavirus Leads to Lethal Pulmonary Edema and Diffuse Alveolar Damage in Adult but Not Young Mice"}}

{"text":"Background: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the most prevalent long-term psychiatric diagnoses among survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Objectives: The objective of this study was to identify the predictors of chronic PTSD in SARS survivors. Design: PTSD at 30 months after the SARS outbreak was assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV. Survivors' demographic data, medical information and psychosocial variables were collected for risk factor analysis. Results: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that female gender as well as the presence of chronic medical illnesses diagnosed before the onset of SARS and avascular necrosis were independent predictors of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS. Associated factors included higher-chance external locus of control, higher functional disability and higher average pain intensity. Conclusion: The study of PTSD at 30 months post-SARS showed that the predictive value of acute medical variables may fade out. Our findings do not support some prior hypotheses that the use of high dose corticosteroids is protective against the development of PTSD. On the contrary, the adversity both before and after the SARS outbreak may be more important in hindering recovery from PTSD. The risk factor analysis can not only improve the detection of hidden psychiatric complications but also provide insight for the possible model of care delivery for the SARS survivors. With the complex interaction of the biopsychosocial challenges of SARS, an integrated multidisciplinary clinic setting may be a superior approach in the long-term management of complicated PTSD cases.","meta":{"paper_id":"9178b1d6f933198524c56affa2c005694cbd39dc","title":"Risk factors for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in SARS survivors"}}

In a large multi-centre European study the prevalences of four key emerging CIRD pathogens; canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine pneumovirus (CnPnV), influenza A, and Mycoplasma cynos (M. cynos); were estimated, and risk factors for exposure, infection and clinical disease were investigated. CIRD affected 66% (381\/572) of the dogs studied, including both pet and kennelled dogs. Disease occurrence and severity were significantly reduced in dogs vaccinated against classic CIRD agents, canine distemper virus (CDV), canine adenovirus 2 (CAV-2) and canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), but substantial proportions (65.7%; 201\/306) of vaccinated dogs remained affected.

Most of these findings were reported during the 2009 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to detail the clinical characteristics of influenza virus-induced lower respiratory infection (LRI) during the A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant 2015e2016 season. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of influenza-induced LRI cases in children admitted to a tertiary children's hospital. Molecular diagnostic evaluation was performed on samples obtained from the most severe cases. Results: We identified 66 patients with influenza-associated hospitalization and included 21 patients with influenza virus-induced LRI for analyses. Twelve patients (57%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, seven (33%) required mechanical ventilation, and three (14%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plastic bronchitis (PB) was identified in six patients (29%), among whom a past medical history of asthma or food allergy were noted in all six patients. A past history of allergic disease was more common among patients with, than among those without, PB (p \u00bc 0.009). A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected from all the PB cases, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes demonstrated that this virus belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2. In the six PB cases, we found one patient with H275Y mutation in neuraminidase.

We used the Global Burden of Diseases 2010 (GBD 2010) methodology to estimate the country-level burden of disease in KSA. We used data from systematic reviews of the literature, household survey data, antenatal clinic surveillance data, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions data, outpatient visit data, population-based cancer registries, active screening data, and other administrative data. Noncommunicable diseases and road traffic injuries became the leading cause of death and disability in KSA in 2010.

{"text":"Background: The mass media are often criticized for oversimplifying the causes of suicide and overlooking some of the risk factors. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support this assertion. The study aims to examine the accuracy of news reports in Hong Kong (HK) and in particular whether or not such reports stereotype victims according to gender and suicide method. Methods: Data from a case-control psychological autopsy (PA) study of 150 HK suicides were utilized. The reports of the PA cases from five major HK newspapers were collected and reviewed to identify whether or not there was a match in terms of the cases' profile and risk factors. Results: The age, gender, and method of the suicides were largely reported correctly (>70%) but accounts of risk factors were seldom accurate (b 46%). No significant difference was found between tabloid-and non-tabloid-type newspapers' accuracy. Media stereotyping of genderspecific suicide and charcoal-burning suicide was identified. Limitations: The study was based on a HK sample so the findings are not necessarily applicable elsewhere. The HK mass media generally demonstrated poor accuracy in reporting suicide risk factors. Their reporting was also problematic in terms of stereotyping gender-and methodspecific suicides. Clinical practitioners should be alerted to these findings when working with the media. They can also adopt this novel usage of PA data to extract further information from other PA studies and thereby broaden the investigation of reporting accuracy and stereotyping of suicide to more diverse social contexts.","meta":{"paper_id":"709fea3df3da75c040b2fa2b8d16074851737d6e","title":"Suicide news reporting accuracy and stereotyping in Hong Kong"}}
{"text":"A case control study on farm level was conducted at the Clinic for Ruminants, LMU Munich, to identify possible risk factors associated with the observed increase in numbers of calves showing clinical signs of Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia (BNP) since 2006 in southern Germany. Interviews were conducted between August 2008 and June 2010. The characteristics of 56 dairy farms with at least one confirmed case of BNP (thrombocytopenia and leukocytopenia and\/or typical findings in post-mortem examination and bone marrow histology) were compared with those of two sets of 50 control dairy farms each, with no history of BNP. The first set of 50 control farms was selected randomly from veterinary practices which had never observed a BNP case on the farms they serviced. The second set of 50 control farms was matched by the veterinary practices which had provided case farms. Two separate analyses were conducted: (1) case farms (n = 56) vs. randomly selected control farms (n = 50) and (2) case farms (n = 56) vs. a matched set of control farms (n = 50). All variables with p < 0.2 in the univariable analysis were included in stepwise logistic regression models. In the first analysis, only the use of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 1292 (95% CI: 114-14707). In the second analysis, conditional logistic regression models did not converge, therefore non-conditional logistic regression models were conducted. In the non-conditional analysis five variables remained in the model, three of which were negatively associated with BNP: the use of vitamin E and selenium, the frequent use of mastitis tubes, and the use of stem growth regulators in grain production. The use of prophylactic measures (such as control of parasites or vaccination of calves against respiratory disease) was positively associated with BNP with an odds ratio of 14.3 as well as the use of PregSure \u00ae BVD vaccine with an odds ratio of 426 (95% CI: 20-9095).","meta":{"paper_id":"d205480b1b5704003ff43d9dbb8b531827fcfb7b","title":""}}

Nosocomial infections are particularly common in premature infants who combine many risk factors : immature immune system, low level of antibodies against several pathogens, parenteral nutrition through central catheter, exposure to close and frequent contacts with multiple stakeholders. Clinical signs of infections are non-specific. Diagnosis lies on increase blood inflammatory parameters and, mainly, blood cultures. Coagulase negative Staphylococci are the predominant pathogen. The rapid evolution of some of these infections and the risk of secondary locations lead to the prescription of a broad-spectrum first-line antibiotic treatment that should be re-evaluated and adjusted secondarily.

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported but risk factors for mortality and a detailed clinical course of illness, including viral shedding, have not been well described. In this retrospective, multicentre cohort study, we included all adult inpatients (\u226518 years old) with laboratoryconfirmed COVID-19 from Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital (Wuhan, China) who had been discharged or had died by Jan 31, 2020. Demographic, clinical, treatment, and laboratory data, including serial samples for viral RNA detection, were extracted from electronic medical records and compared between survivors and non-survivors. We used univariable and multivariable logistic regression methods to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age (odds ratio 1\u00b710, 95% CI 1\u00b703-1\u00b717, per year increase; p=0\u00b70043), higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (5\u00b765, 2\u00b761-12\u00b723; p<0\u00b70001), and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g\/mL (18\u00b742, 2\u00b764-128\u00b755; p=0\u00b70033) on admission. Median duration of viral shedding was 20\u00b70 days (IQR 17\u00b70-24\u00b70) in survivors, but SARS-CoV-2 was detectable until death in non-survivors. The longest observed duration of viral shedding in survivors was 37 days. Interpretation The potential risk factors of older age, high SOFA score, and d-dimer greater than 1 \u00b5g\/mL could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage. Prolonged viral shedding provides the rationale for a strategy of isolation of infected patients and optimal antiviral interventions in the future.","meta":{"paper_id":"8330d31a5ec8b240991ed6d5a0dcbaf967f7dbd0","title":"Clinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study"}}

Methods: Data on 479 male participants within two shelters who completed questionnaires and a total of 950 nasal and pharyngeal samples were collected during the winters of 2015e2017. Respiratory pathogen carriage including seven viruses and four bacteria was assessed by quantitative PCR. Results: The homeless population was characterized by a majority of individuals of North African origin (300\/479, 62.6%) with a relatively high prevalence of chronic homelessness (175\/465, 37.6%). We found a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and signs (168\/476, 35.3%), a very high prevalence of bacterial carriage (313\/477, 65.6%), especially Haemophilus influenzae (280\/477, 58.7%), and a lower prevalence of virus carriage (51\/473, 10.8%) with human rhinovirus being the most frequent (25\/473, 5.3%). Differences were observed between the microbial communities of the nose and throat. Duration of homelessness (odds ratio (OR) 1.77, p 0.017), chronic respiratory diseases (OR 5.27, p <0.0001) and visiting countries of origin for migrants (OR 1.68, p 0.035) were identified as independent risk factors for respiratory symptoms and signs. A strong association between virus (OR 2.40, p 0.012) or Streptococcus pneumoniae (OR 2.32, p 0.014) carriage and respiratory symptoms and signs was also found.

An adverse or suboptimal fetal environment can cause irreversible changes in brain that can subsequently exert long-lasting effects through resetting a diverse array of biological systems including endocrine, immune and nervous. It is evident from animal and imaging studies that subtle variations in the intrauterine environment can cause recognizable differences in brain structure and cognitive functions in the offspring. A wide variety of environmental factors may play a role in precipitating the emergent developmental dysregulation and the consequent evolution of psychiatric traits in early adulthood by inducing inflammatory, oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, and epigenetic dysregulation.

Methods: During October 26, 2009, and January 23, 2010, adult patients with pneumonia with laboratory-confi rmed or clinically suspected A(H1N1) Results: Of the 65 case subjects, the median age was 41 (interquartile range [IQR], 28-57) years, 60.0% were men, and 55.4% had at least one underlying medical condition. Sixty-two patients started oseltamivir therapy within a median of 5 (IQR, 4-6) days from the onset of illness, and 31 received IV corticosteroids. ARDS developed in 33 patients, and 24 were treated initially with noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV). In this group, NPPV was successful in 13 patients (54.2%). Nine patients died at a median of 16 (IQR, 10-24) days after onset of illness. Multivariate Cox regression identifi ed two independent risk factors for death: progressive dyspnea after resolution of fever (relative risk, 5.852; 95% CI, 1.395-24.541; P 5 .016) and a higher APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) II score on presentation (relative risk for each point, 1.312; 95% CI, 1.140-1.511; P , .001). At 3-month follow-up of survivors with A(H1N1), ground-glass opacities were still present, although diminished, in 85.7%, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide was mildly reduced in 61.5%.

{"text":"During the course of an epidemic, estimating the risk of death and identifying risk factors of death are of utmost importance for public health assessment of the severity of infection. The real-time estimation involves a number of important statistical problems to consider, and this chapter comprehensively describes commonly used estimation methods and their pitfalls. When estimating the case fatality risk (CFR) during the course of an epidemic, the data are right-censored because of the time delay from illness onset to death. A conventional survival analysis technique is employed for addressing right censoring. Identification of risk factors of death also requires the care for censored nature of the data, and we have devised a method that combines the survival analysis and logistic regression. Ascertainment bias is always a practical issue in interpreting the absolute value of the CFR or comparing CFR between different groups, and recent studies have shown that observational effort including seroepidemiological survey has to be made to overcome this bias.","meta":{"paper_id":"407d0624c819defbf98c4991b5e8f7c03e5b88fa","title":"Real-Time Estimation of the Case Fatality Ratio and Risk Factors of Death"}}
{"text":"In northeastern Thai (Isaan) culture traditional raw fish dishes and raw fish-eating habits are common. Eating and sharing meals together among the community's members, especially relatives and neighbours, are a common practice in both daily life and social gathering events. Fish are a significant protein source and are associated with variety of traditional recipes. Cyprinid fish are one of the most preferred fish by Isaan villagers for daily consumption because they are accessible and affordable. Consumption of these fish probably causes the persistence of high endemicity of human liver fluke infection, particularly with Opisthorchis viverrini, in northeast Thailand. Because the consumption of raw cyprinid fish is a well-documented risk factor for liver fluke infection, sharing of risky raw fish dishes may influence disease transmission through a community. Social network analysis was used to investigate fish and fish-based meal sharing among household members in Isaan villages in liver fluke endemic areas. The findings from three studies confirmed the persistence of traditional Isaan raw fish consumption and food-sharing practice. Social connections via food sharing among villagers played an important role in liver fluke infection and transmission dynamics as a risk factor. Thus these sociocultural factors should be taken into account in designing strategies for control of opisthorchiasis and other food-borne illnesses at the community level.","meta":{"paper_id":"627299eae35e71c737281db1c3d82596b1675db6","title":"Social Influence in Liver Fluke Transmission: Application of Social Network Analysis of Food Sharing in Thai Isaan Culture"}}

Paul Healthcare personnel IgG Incidence Middle East respiratory syndrome Personal protective equipment a b s t r a c t Given the mode of transmission of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), healthcare workers (HCWs) in contact with MERS patients are expected to be at risk of MERS infections. We evaluated the prevalence of MERS coronavirus (CoV) immunoglobulin (Ig) G in HCWs exposed to MERS patients and calculated the incidence of MERS-affected cases in HCWs. We enrolled HCWs from hospitals where confirmed MERS patients had visited. Serum was collected 4 to 6 weeks after the last contact with a confirmed MERS patient. We performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to screen for the presence of MERS-CoV IgG and an indirect immunofluorescence test (IIFT) to confirm MERS-CoV IgG. We used a questionnaire to collect information regarding the exposure. We calculated the incidence of MERS-affected cases by dividing the sum of PCR-confirmed and serology-confirmed cases by the number of exposed HCWs in participating hospitals. In total, 1169 HCWs in 31 hospitals had contact with 114 MERS patients, and among the HCWs, 15 were PCR-confirmed MERS cases in study hospitals. Serologic analysis was performed for 737 participants. ELISA was positive in five participants and borderline for seven. IIFT was positive for two (0.3%) of these 12 participants. Among the participants who did not use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), seropositivity was 0.7% (2\/294) compared to 0% (0\/ 443) in cases with appropriate PPE use.

Such an understanding of the relatedness of newly discovered filoviruses may help to predict risk factors for outbreaks of hemorrhagic disease in humans and\/or non-human primates. Recent discoveries such as three distinct genotypes of Reston ebolavirus, unexpectedly discovered in domestic swine in the Philippines; as well as a new species, Bundibugyo ebolavirus; the recent discovery of Lloviu virus as a potential new genus, Cuevavirus, within Filoviridae; and germline integrations of filovirus-like sequences in some animal species bring new insights into the relatedness of filoviruses, their prevalence and potential for transmission to humans.

Risk factors for a poor outcome among children admitted with clinically severe pneumonia to a university hospital in Rabat, Morocco Objectives: Data on prognostic factors among children with severe pneumonia are scarce in middleincome countries. We investigated prognostic factors for an adverse outcome among children admitted to the H\u00f4 pital d'Enfants de Rabat, Morocco with World Health Organization-defined clinically severe pneumonia (CSP). Methods: Children aged 2-59 months admitted to the hospital and fulfilling the CSP definition were recruited into this 13-month prospective study. A poor prognosis was defined as death, a need for intensive care, or a Respiratory Index of Severity in Children (RISC) score !3. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to ascertain independent predictive factors for a poor prognosis. Results: Of the 689 children included in this analysis, 55 (8.0%) required intensive care and 28 died (4.0%). Five hundred and two (72.8%) children were classified as having a good prognosis and 187 (27.2%) as having a poor prognosis. A history of prematurity (odds ratio (OR) 2.50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-5.04), of fever (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.32-3.83), living in a house with smokers (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.18-2.72), impaired consciousness (OR 10.96, 95% CI 2.88-41.73), cyanosis (OR 2.09, 95% CI 1.05-4.15), pallor (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.34-3.84), having rhonchi on auscultation (OR 2.45, 95% CI 1.58-3.79), and human metapneumovirus infection (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.13-4.02) were all independent risk factors for an adverse outcome, whereas a history of asthma (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.84) was the only independent risk factor for a positive outcome. Conclusions: The early identification of factors associated with a poor prognosis could improve management strategies and the likelihood of survival of Moroccan children with severe pneumonia.","meta":{"paper_id":"7574e8c8c1e0e6df24e6ef15177e2eff23262511","title":""}}

{"text":"Humans are colonized after birth by microbial organisms that form a heterogeneous community, collectively termed microbiota. The genomic pool of this macro-community is named microbiome. The gut microbiota is essential for the complete development of the immune system, representing a binary network in which the microbiota interact with the host providing important immune and physiologic function and conversely the bacteria protect themselves from host immune defense. Alterations in the balance of the gut microbiome due to a combination of environmental and genetic factors can now be associated with detrimental or protective effects in experimental autoimmune diseases. These gut microbiome alterations can unbalance the gastrointestinal immune responses and influence distal effector sites leading to CNS disease including both demyelination and affective disorders. The current range of risk factors for MS includes genetic makeup and environmental elements. Of interest to this review is the consistency between this range of MS risk factors and the gut microbiome. We postulate that the gut microbiome serves as the niche where different MS risk factors merge, thereby influencing the disease process. (J. Ochoa-Rep\u00e1raz).

Environmental, genetics and microbial risk factors associated with CNS demyelinating disease Environmental, genetic, immunological and infectious diseases have been associated with MS [2]. The genetic background is thought to be a critical epidemiologic risk factor. As reviewed by Compton and colleagues, the familial recurrence rate in MS is 20% [7] . Monozygotic twins, sharing the 100% of the genetic information, have an MS lifetime risk of approximately 25-30%, siblings with two affected parents approximately a 20%, whereas dizygotic twins have a 5% lifetime risk, frequencies that suggest that the genetic background could interact with other risk factors. Alterations in immuno-regulatory or structural genes might increase the susceptibility to MS. Differences in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system-genes in the chromosome 6 that serve as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in humans-haplotypes DRBl*1501 and DQ6 have been suggested as genetic risk factors [8] . Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reveal an evident effect of these genetic risk factors, with particular importance of HLA class II region, but also class I [9,10]. Interestingly, the genetic factors associated with MS are involved in immunological processes [11] , providing strong theoretical support to the autoimmune nature of MS, and moreover, provides the potential framework that environmental factors may be intimately involved in the modulation and\/or perhaps even the trigger for disease susceptibility.","meta":{"paper_id":"0c5c7c0eda4954c87bac8bc496087b963d006796","title":"Gut microbiome and the risk factors in central nervous system autoimmunity"}}
{"text":"Asthma is the most common chronic lower respiratory tract disease in childhood throughout the world. Despite advances in asthma management, acute exacerbations continue to be a major problem in patients and they result in a considerable burden on direct\/indirect health care providers. A severe exacerbation occurring within 1 year is an independent risk factor. Respiratory tract viruses have emerged as the most frequent triggers of exacerbations in children. It is becoming increasingly clear that interactions may exist between viruses and other triggers, increasing the likelihood of an exacerbation. In this study, we provide an overview of current knowledge about asthma exacerbations, including its definition, impact on health care providers, and associated factors. Prevention management in intermittent asthma as well as intermittent wheeze in pre-school children and those with persistent asthma are discussed. Our review findings support the importance of controlling persistent asthma, as indicated in current guidelines. In addition, we found that early episodic intervention appeared to be crucial in preventing severe attacks and future exacerbations. Besides the use of medication, timely education after an exacerbation along with a comprehensive plan in follow up is also vitally important.","meta":{"paper_id":"db2c54ab3f36dd546460c0e72aefdc17abf5355c","title":"Asthma Exacerbation in Children: A Practical Review"}}
{"text":"RATIONALE: In infancy, rhinovirus illnesses and severe RSV bronchiolitis indicate increased risk for recurrent wheezing and asthma, but there is less information about other viruses. We evaluated the frequency and severity of metapneumovirus (HMPV) and coronavirus (HCV) infections in a high-risk group of infants. METHODS: Nasal lavage samples were obtained in the first year of life during scheduled study visits and symptomatic respiratory illnesses as part of the Childhood Origins of Asthma Project (COAST). Samples (n 5 567) were analyzed by Respiratory Multicode Assay (RMA) for HMPV, HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-SARS. RESULTS: HMPV was isolated in 10.7% of samples during illnesses (n 5 291), and also occurred with other respiratory viruses (4.8%). 47.8% of HMPV illnesses included wheezing. HCV were isolated in 19.2% of the samples during illnesses and included HCV-OC43 (10.0%) and HCV-NL63 (9.6%). In addition, HCV was commonly detected together with other respiratory viruses (6.5%). Of all HCV illnesses (n 5 42), 33.3% included wheezing; however, HCV-NL63 had a significantly higher wheezing rate compared to HCV-OC43 (37.5% vs. 4.5%, p 5 0.028). Children who had at least one HCV-NL63 illness during infancy were significantly more likely to have asthma at age 6 compared to those without HCV-NL63 illnesses (52.2% vs. 25.0%, p 5 0.007). Having either HCV-OC43 or HMPV was not a risk factor for asthma at age 6. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in viral diagnostics has allowed for identification of viruses that are difficult to culture. In infancy, HCV-NL63, HCV-OC43 and HMPV were significant causes of wheezing illnesses, however, only HCV-NL63 was significantly associated with asthma development at age six.","meta":{"paper_id":"34ba72963a44bbe5ce71b7ec96c6f71dd1069c2e","title":"574 Coronavirus NL63 Illnesses in Infancy are a Risk Factor for Asthma at Age Six 575 Seasonal Distribution Of Respiratory Viruses In Pediatric"}}

Bronchiolitis is the most common acute respiratory infection in children under 1 year of age, and the most common cause of hospitalization in this age group. RSV accounts for approximately 70% of all these cases, followed by rhinovirus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus and bocavirus. The association between bronchiolitis caused by RSV and the development of recurrent wheezing and\/or asthma was first described more than 40 years ago, but it is still unclear whether bronchiolitis causes chronic respiratory symptoms, or if it is a marker for children with a genetic predisposition for developing asthma in the medium or long term. In any case, sufficient evidence is available to corroborate the existence of this association, which is particularly strong when the causative agent of bronchiolitis is rhinovirus. The pathogenic role of respiratory viruses as triggers for exacerbations in asthmatic patients has not been fully characterized. However, it is clear that respiratory viruses, and in particular rhinovirus, are the most common causes of exacerbation in children, and some type of respiratory virus has been identified in over 90% of children hospitalized for an episode of wheezing. Changes in the immune response to viral infections in genetically predisposed individuals are very likely to be the main factors involved in the association between viral infection and asthma.","meta":{"paper_id":"a5399231d85b304d316778dbe87a845d81db311a","title":"Pediatric Asthma and Viral Infection \u0b1d"}}
{"text":"Aim: We investigated the effect of massive doses of corticosteroid therapy on bone metabolism using specific biochemical markers of bone metabolism, and the prevalence of osteonecrosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients at a university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Methods: Seventy-one patients with a clinical diagnosis of SARS were studied according to the modified World Health Organization case definition of SARS who were involved in the SARS epidemic between 10 March and 20 June 2003. The clinical diagnosis was confirmed by serological test and\/ or molecular analysis. Biochemical markers of bone metabolism were analysed retrospectively using serial clotted blood samples collected from each patient during the course of hospital admission to discharge and subsequent follow-up at out-patient clinic using the arbitrary time periods: (i) Day ,10; (ii) Day 28-44; (iii) Day 51-84; and (iv) Day .90 after the onset of fever. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee and hip joints were performed post-admission to evaluate the prevalence of osteonecrosis amongst these SARS patients. Various risk factors for the development of osteonecrosis were assessed using receiver operating characteristics curve comparison with appropriate test statistics and Spearman's coefficients of rank correlation with biochemical bone markers. Results: Biochemical markers of bone metabolism showed significant bone resorption as evidenced by a marked increase in serum C-terminal telopeptide concentration (CTx) from Day 28-44 after the onset of fever. With tapering down of corticosteroid dosage, CTx started to return to previous baseline level from Day 51 onwards, while other bone formation markers, serum osteocalcin and bonespecific alkaline phosphatase concentrations (OC and BALP, respectively), started to increase. The latter effect was even more marked after Day .90. Seven patients developed radiological evidence of osteonecrosis. The prevalence of osteonecrosis in this cohort was 9.9%. A total corticosteroid dosage of .1900 mg hydrocortisone, .2000 mg methylprednisolone, .13 340 mg hydrocortisone-equivalent corticosteroid therapy, and .18 days on corticosteroid therapy were found to be significant risk factors for the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. There were also significant positive correlations amongst various biochemical bone markers in this patient cohort. Conclusions: Both bone resorption and formation markers were unable to predict the subsequent development of osteonecrosis. The use of high dose of hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone for an extended duration was shown to be a significant risk factor for osteonecrosis. Its prevalence in this cohort is comparable to those reported in the literature for SARS patients with high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The Day 28-44 increase in the serum CTx coincided with the timing of corticosteroid use. The Day .51 increase in serum OC and BALP coincided with the timing of corticosteroid withdrawal.","meta":{"paper_id":"72778f96bab51a8cbebeb6a18f3333566d7a17f3","title":"Steroid-induced osteonecrosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome: a retrospective analysis of biochemical markers of bone metabolism and corticosteroid therapy"}}

{"text":"Respiratory syncytial virus Nasopharyngeal aspirate Bronchiolitis Respiratory PCR Background: Bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization in young children. In addition to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), other viruses have been increasingly implicated. Guidance on testing has also changed. Aims: To compare clinicopathological outcomes in young children admitted with bronchiolitis due to RSV in comparison with rhinovirus (RV), and identify associated risk\/ epidemiological factors. Methods: Children aged less than two years admitted to hospital with a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis with positive results for either RSV or RV were included in this study. Polymerase-chain-reaction-negative cases using an extended respiratory virus panel served as a control group. Retrospective data were collected on sex, risk factors, respiratory support, intravenous fluids and antibiotics. Outcomes such as length of stay (LOS) and need for transfer to the high-dependency unit\/paediatric intensive care unit were included. Findings: Two hundred and twenty-seven out of 437 nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were positive for either RSV (N \u00bc 162) or RV (N \u00bc 65). The median age of cases was three months and 75% had at least one risk factor. Risk factors were higher in the RV group (P \u00bc 0.004). RV accounted for the majority of cases outside the RSV season (P < 0.01). RVassociated bronchiolitis had a longer LOS (more than seven days) (P < 0.05) and increased need for chest X-rays and\/or antibiotics (P < 0.05). Use of intravenous fluids and respiratory support were higher in the RV group, but the difference was not significant. Conclusions: RV is the second most common pathogen associated with bronchiolitis and is isolated all year round. This may be important in those with risk factors resulting in prolonged LOS. Further research is necessary to establish the exact role of RV in this common condition, particularly outside the traditional RSV season.

{"text":"Background: Patients with chronic inflammatory lung diseases, such as asthma, are at higher risk for influenza-like illness (ILI) complications. Viral infections are known to trigger asthma exacerbations, but a thorough description of the clinical characteristics of ILI-associated asthma exacerbations and the role of viruses as a risk factor for severe exacerbation (SE) in ILI has not been published yet. Objective: To investigate risk factors for SE in patients with ILI and asthma. Methods: Patients with ILI symptoms were recruited from 6 hospitals of Mexico (LaRed sites) during 2010 to 2014. Those with a previous asthma diagnosis and ILI symptoms and who were 5 years or older were included. Patients were assigned as cases or controls based on symptoms reported. SE was defined when participants presented with wheezing or dyspnea and required hospitalization. Results: A total of 486 patients with ILI and a diagnosis of asthma were included. There were no differences in the proportion, number, or type of viral illness among those with and without SE. Those with SE were less likely to report ILI symptoms. Muscle pain and nasal drip were predictors for patients not progressing to SE. A delay in seeking medical care was associated with SE (odds ratio, 2.93; 95% CI, 1.46-5.88). Conclusion: The presence of a particular virus did not predict SE. ILI symptoms in asthma patients are not associated with severe exacerbation. Patients with asthma should be encouraged to seek early medical care when ILI symptoms are first noticed to prevent serious complications.","meta":{"paper_id":"498cc1e1dfb7d2f3933a1fe58409156ec4297857","title":"Clinical characteristics of asthmatic patients with influenza-like illness and risk of severe exacerbations in Mexico"}}
{"text":"Pandemic H1N1 s u m m a r y Surveillance is an essential foundation for monitoring and evaluating any disease process, and is especially critical when new disease agents appear. The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 tested the capacities of countries to detect, assess, notify and report events as required by the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR). As detailed in the IHR, the World Health Organization drew on official reports from Member States as well as unofficial sources (e.g. media alerts) to quickly report and disseminate information about the appearance of the novel influenza virus. The pre-existing Global Influenza Surveillance Network for virological surveillance also provided crucial information for rapid development of a vaccine and for detection of changes in the virus. However, the pandemic also highlighted a number of shortcomings in global epidemiological surveillance for respiratory disease. These included the lack of standards for reporting illness, risk factor and mortality data, and a mechanism for systematic reporting of epidemiological data. Such measures would have facilitated direct comparison of data between countries and improved timely understanding of the characteristics and impact of the pandemic. This paper describes the surveillance strategies in place before the pandemic and the methods that were used at global level to monitor the pandemic.

{"text":"Background: Premature coronary artery disease (CAD) is a special entity with a strong link to familial hypercholesterolemia, family history of premature CAD, or multiple coexistent atherosclerotic risk factors. Drug-eluting stenting (DES), including paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES) and sirolimus-eluting stenting (SES), has been proven to have a lower restenotic rate. However, to date, few studies have investigated the clinical and angiographic results of DES in premature CAD patients. Methods: Between February 2004 and October 2005, premature CAD patients, defined as those younger than 50 years of age, who were treated with DES in our medical center were all retrospectively enrolled. Their baseline clinical characteristics, clinical outcome and angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. Results: A total of 26 patients (M\/F: 23\/3) were enrolled, with a mean age of 44 \u00b1 6 years (range, 24-50 years). Conventional atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent in this study group, including diabetes mellitus (35%), hypertension (35%), hyperlipidemia (54%) and smoking (73%). Moreover, there was 1 homozygous and 1 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia case in our study group. In terms of angiographic results, there were 40 target lesions in 34 target vessels. Forty DES (39 PES, 1 SES) were implanted with a median stent diameter of 3 mm and median length of 24 mm. The clinical follow-up was counted up to May 2006, with a mean follow-up duration of 540 \u00b1 168 days; 11 (42%) patients had a second angiogram during the follow-up period (200 \u00b1 98 days after DES). None of the patients had target lesion revascularization (TLR). In addition, there was no difference in TLR or stent thrombosis between patients with or without acute coronary syndrome. Conclusion: Based on our single-center experience, DES had good short-term follow-up results for a premature CAD group with diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.

{"text":"35\u00b77% of cases. As of Feb 28, 2018, 2182 cases of MERS-CoV infection (with 779 deaths) in 27 countries were reported to WHO worldwide, with most being reported in Saudi Arabia (1807 cases with 705 deaths). MERS-CoV features prominently in the WHO blueprint list of priority pathogens that threaten global health security. Although primary transmission of MERS-CoV to human beings is linked to exposure to dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius), the exact mode by which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains undefined. Up to 50% of MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia have been classified as secondary, occurring from human-to-human transmission through contact with asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals infected with MERS-CoV. Hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV are a hallmark of MERS-CoV infection. The clinical features associated with MERS-CoV infection are not MERS-specific and are similar to other respiratory tract infections. Thus, the diagnosis of MERS can easily be missed, unless the doctor or health-care worker has a high degree of clinical awareness and the patient undergoes specific testing for MERS-CoV. The largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in South Korea in May, 2015, resulting in 186 cases with 38 deaths. This outbreak was caused by a traveller with undiagnosed MERS-CoV infection who became ill after returning to Seoul from a trip to the Middle East. The traveller visited several health facilities in South Korea, transmitting the virus to many other individuals long before a diagnosis was made. With 10 million pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia each year from 182 countries, watchful surveillance by public health systems, and a high degree of clinical awareness of the possibility of MERS-CoV infection is essential.

{"text":"To improve understanding of severe group A streptococcal (GAS) disease in Europe and achieve an integrated picture of these infections, the Strep-EURO project comprising 11 countries started in September 2002. A European case definition for severe invasive GAS disease was agreed upon amongst all participants. In order to obtain nation-wide coverage, information on the project was given to infectioncontrol units, relevant hospitals and microbiological laboratories. A clinical questionnaire containing background identification data, possible predisposing factors, portal of entry of infection, epidemiological risk factors, source of isolate, clinical condition, complications and outcome, was used for each case. Enhanced surveillance of GAS invasive disease commenced on 1 January 2003 for a two-year period. By July 2004, over 5000 invasive GAS isolates were collected of which more than 3000 were from UK. The disease incidence rate in the different countries seems to vary from 2 to 3.8 per 100,000 population. Molecular methods for typing and clonal identification of clinical isolates were used. An overall increase of new invasive types is noted. Higher emm types (77, 78, 81, 82, 83, 87, 89) were thus reported from almost all partners, in contrast to types 1, 3 and 28 being predominant for several years. In Sweden, for example, emm types 81 and 89 accounted for a majority of isolates. This unusual change of type distribution in Europe is of serious concern. A high level of MLS antibiotic resistance in some countries (France, Italy) and very frequent tetracycline resistance in almost all countries was noted. Furthermore, pathogenic aspects of severe GAS disease, such as proteolytic activation of the contact system, and selected virulence factors, such as surface proteins and superantigens, were investigated. A new Strep-EURO website (www.strep-euro.lu.se) was constructed and updated regularly. The website is linked with other, relevant websites and contains both an \"intra-net\" site accessible to those persons participating within the project, and an \"extra-net\" site for the general public. A central database for severe GAS cases, receiving clinical and laboratory information from the local databases was also established. Strep-EURO has now created a European network for epidemiological analysis and surveillance of severe streptococcal disease in ten EU and one Associated Countries. Objectives: Strep-EURO is an EU FP-5 funded programme designed to greatly enhance our understanding of severe group A streptococcal (GAS) infections. We present early epidemiological findings gathered by the UK team. Methods: Enhanced population-based surveillance was implemented in the UK in part fulfilment of the strep-EURO objectives. Two pre-existing data sources were reconciled to maximise case ascertainment: routine national surveillance based on local microbiological investigation; isolate referral to the national reference laboratory. Individual cases were followed-up to capture clinical and epidemiological information. Preliminary data relating to cases diagnosed in 2003 were analysed to determine the burden, clinical presentation and risk factors for disease and microbiological characteristics of strains. Results: A total of 2064 cases were reported by 223 laboratories across England and Wales, an overall incidence of 3.93 per 100,000 population. A clear seasonal pattern was apparent, with peak incidence from mid-March to -April. The observed incidence in males was higher than in females (RR = 1.29; 95% CI: 1.18-1.41). Twelve percent of cases occurred in children (<18 years). Ninety percent of cases were bacteraemic, 10% had septic arthritis and 9% pneumonia. Other clinical manifestations included toxic shock-like syndrome (6%), necrotising fasciitis (5%), puerperal sepsis (3%) and meningitis (1%). Skin lesions\/wounds were the most common predisposing factor, with injecting drug use reported in 30% of cases; 28% had no predisposing\/risk factors identified. Nineteen percent of cases were reported as having died within 7 days of diagnosis. Local microbiological analysis identified 4% of GAS isolates as erythromycin resistant. Type characterisation of strains using a combination of serological and sequencing techniques revealed over 35 M-types, with M1, M3 and M87most common. Conclusion: Enhanced surveillance of severe GAS infections is beginning to yield information of value in targeting public health initiatives. Our estimation of disease burden has been substantially improved, as has our understanding of the role of specific risk factors such as injecting drug use. Comparison with other European countries will further our understanding of these data. The objectives of our study were to create an animal model of aerosol infection with Coxiella burnetiiphase I (Nine Mile strain) and to determine the pathogenic potential of the organism in C57BL\/6 mice exposed to an infectious aerosol with an inoculum of 2 \u00d7 10 9 bacteria. Mice (N = 15) were inoculated using an aerosolisation device for 45 min. Five mice were sacrificed at day 0, 7 and 14 of the study. C. burnetii detection was performed by Light Cycler Nested PCR assay in lungs and blood samples. Antibodies to phases I and II C. burnetii whole cell antigens were determined in the sera by immunofluorescence testing. Inflammatory reactions in lungs and spleen samples were investigated by histological and immunohistological analysis. C. burnetii was detected by genomic amplification in the blood of mice sacrificed at day 7 and in all lung samples. All infected mice sacrificed at day 14 had developed antibodies to C. burnetii phases I and II antigens (titer of 1:1600). Inflammatory infiltrates were seen in the lungs of mice sacrificed at day 7 and 14, bacteria were detected by immunohistochemistry in the macrophages cells. In our study, we demonstrated that the infection first resulted in an interstitial pneumonia. C. burnetii was then released and may spread hematogenously to other organs. As a conclusion, this murine model of aerosol-induced experimental Q fever is the first step for studies on acute Q fever, especially in terms of pathogenicity.","meta":{"paper_id":"d98f00b09ea913c492633de237549b521f90d12f","title":"Oral Abstracts 11\/3S Severe Streptococcus pyogenes infections in Europe: Strep-Euro two years on 12\/3S Nosocomial Streptococcus pyogenes infections"}}

Severe caseloads (> 40 cases per annum) were reported by 26 (11 %) hospitals (median 60 cases; IQR 50-110). Case reporting, case numbers, and without-treatment euthanasia were significantly associated with disadvantage across all Socio-Economic Index for Areas quintiles (p < 0.0001) -the greater the disadvantage, the more reports. Strong negative correlations were found between case numbers and the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (r SP = -0.3357, p < 0.0001) and also between euthanasia and the Index of Education and Occupation (r SP = -0.3762, p < 0.0001).

{"text":"The trichomonad species Tritrichomonas fetus and Pentatrichomonas hominis were recently identified in the feces of dogs with diarrhea. However the prevalence and pathogenicity of these parasites in the canine population still remained poorly resolved. Therefore the aim of the present study was (1) to determine the prevalence of trichomonads infecting puppies living in French breeding kennels, (2) to confirm the predominance of P. hominis in dogs, (3) to investigate the genetic diversity of P. hominis isolates identified in the French canine population and (4) to evaluate the risk factors for infection by P. hominis and the influence of the parasite on feces consistency. A total of 215 both diarrheic and non-diarrheic puppies from 25 French breeding kennels were included in this epidemiological survey. Fecal samples from each puppy were examined for 6 gastrointestinal pathogens: parvovirus type 2 (CPV2), coronavirus, Toxocara canis, Cystoisospora ohioensis-complex, Cystoisospora canis, and Giardia intestinalis. A part of each collected stool was also tested for the presence of motile trichomonads by microscopy after culturing. The prevalence of trichomonad infection was 15.8% (34\/215) among puppies and 20% (5\/25) among breeding kennels. DNA from 26 of the 34 positive samples was successfully amplified using a trichomonad-specific primer pair. Analysis of the sequences of PCR products indicated that P. hominis was the only trichomonad infecting the canine population. All the puppies infected with P. hominis belonged to large breed dogs. Moreover, puppies from large breeding kennels, excreting a high level of G. intestinalis and\/or excreting a high level of C. canis oocysts showed a higher probability of being positive for P. hominis infection. Univariate analysis also revealed an increased risk for P. hominis infection in puppies with abnormal feces. However, in a multivariate analysis, CPV2 was the only gastrointestinal pathogen associated with abnormal feces. Since enteropathogens were commonly found in dogs infected by P. hominis, the pathogenic potential of this trichomonad species remained uncertain and has to be further evaluated by experimental infection studies.","meta":{"paper_id":"fae4be955c26b2771a6eb3ab5405ffdbbc2186b9","title":"Prevalence, risk factors of infection and molecular characterization of trichomonads in puppies from French breeding kennels"}}
{"text":"Purpose: This study evaluates the use of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) to differentiate smear-positive, active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) from other pulmonary infections in the emergency room (ER) setting. Methods: One hundred and eighty-three patients diagnosed with pulmonary infections in an ER were divided into an acid fast bacillus (AFB) smear-positive, active PTB group (G1 = 84) and a non-AFB smearpositive, pulmonary infection group (G2 = 99). HRCT images from a 64-Multidetector CT were analyzed, retrospectively, for the morphology, number, and segmental distribution of pulmonary lesions. Results: Utilizing multivariate analysis, five variables were found to be independent risk factors predictive of G1: (1) consolidation involving the apex segment of right upper lobe, posterior segment of the right upper lobe, or apico-posterior segment of the left upper lobe; (2) consolidation involving the superior segment of the right or left lower lobe; (3) presence of a cavitary lesion; (4) presence of clusters of nodules; (5) absence of centrilobular nodules.

Findings Fever and pneumonia initially improved but 64 (85%) patients developed recurrent fever after a mean of 8\u00b79 (SD 3\u00b71) days, 55 (73%) had watery diarrhoea after 7\u00b75 (2\u00b73) days, 60 (80%) had radiological worsening after 7\u00b74 (2\u00b72) days, and respiratory symptoms worsened in 34 (45%) after 8\u00b76 (3\u00b70) days. In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0\u00b7001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days. Interpretation The consistent clinical progression, shifting radiological infiltrates, and an inverted V viral-load profile suggest that worsening in week 2 is unrelated to uncontrolled viral replication but may be related to immunopathological damage.","meta":{"paper_id":"a80c3e9dfde9824cb8f54f9f382d0d601743ffc0","title":"Clinical progression and viral load in a community outbreak of coronavirus-associated SARS pneumonia: a prospective study"}}
{"text":"Most clinical applications of human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for cell therapy, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, and treatment of immune and inflammatory diseases require a phase of isolation and ex vivo expansion allowing a clinically meaningful cell number to be reached. Conditions used for cell isolation and expansion should meet strict quality and safety requirements. This is particularly true for the growth medium used for MSC isolation and expansion. Basal growth media used for MSC expansion are supplemented with multiple nutrients and growth factors. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has long been the gold standard medium supplement for laboratory-scale MSC culture. However, FBS has a poorly characterized composition and poses risk factors, as it may be a source of xenogenic antigens and zoonotic infections. FBS has therefore become undesirable as a growth medium supplement for isolating and expanding MSCs for human therapy protocols. In recent years, human blood materials, and most particularly lysates and releasates of platelet concentrates have emerged as efficient medium supplements for isolating and expanding MSCs from various origins. This review analyzes the advantages and limits of using human platelet materials as medium supplements for MSC isolation and expansion. We present the modes of production of allogeneic and autologous platelet concentrates, measures taken to ensure optimal pathogen safety profiles, and methods of preparing PLs for MSC expansion. We also discuss the supply of such blood preparations. Produced under optimal conditions of standardization and safety, human platelet materials can become the future 'gold standard' supplement for ex vivo production of MSCs for translational medicine and cell therapy applications.","meta":{"paper_id":"1cd18a394a1ab05d7f574241ccb09775f6851222","title":"Preparation, quality criteria, and properties of human blood platelet lysate supplements for ex vivo stem cell expansion"}}

This may be attributed to a high risk of disease as veal calves are often purchased from numerous dairy herds, exposed to stress related to the transport and commingling of new animals, and fed a new ration. In this study, we used national register data to characterize the use of antimicrobials registered for large Danish veal calf and young bull producing herds in 2014. A total of 325 herds with veal calf and potentially young bull production were identified from the Danish Cattle database. According to the national Danish database on drugs for veterinary use (VetStat), a total of 537,399 Animal Daily Doses (ADD 200 ) were registered for these 325 herds during 2014. The amount of antimicrobials registered in 2014 varied throughout the year, with the highest amounts registered in autumn and winter. Antimicrobials were registered for respiratory disorders (79%), joints\/limbs\/CNS disorders (17%), gastrointestinal disorders (3.7%) and other disorders (0.3%). Of the registered antimicrobials, 15% were for oral and 85% for parenteral administration. Long-acting formulations with a therapeutic effect of more than 48 h covered 58% of the drugs for parenteral use. Standardized at the herd-level, as ADD 200 \/100 calves\/day, antimicrobial use distributed as median [CI 95% ] for starter herds (n = 22): 2.14 [0.19;7.58], finisher herds (n = 24): 0.48 [0.00;1.48], full-line herds (n = 183): 0.78 [0.05;2.20] and herds with an inconsistent pattern of movements (n = 96): 0.62 [0.00;2.24]. Full-line herds are herds, which purchase calves directly from a dairy herd and raise them to slaughter. Furthermore, we performed a risk factor analysis on the 183 herds with a full-line production. Here, we investigated, whether the number of suppliers, the number of calves purchased, the frequency of purchase, the average age at introduction, the average time in the herd and vaccination influenced the amount of antimicrobials used in the herds. The final multivariable regression analysis revealed that the number of calves introduced was positively associated with the antimicrobial use in the herd.","meta":{"paper_id":"b14e728770740bd96a18659cb80b2006d77ee250","title":"A register-based study of the antimicrobial usage in Danish veal calves and young bulls"}}
{"text":"Genetic and environmental factors jointly determine the susceptibility to develop Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved substantial progress in defining the genetic architecture, underlying susceptibility to MS. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles within the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes. Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and for non-MHC regions. The role of environmental risk factors and their interaction with genetic susceptibility alleles are much less well defined, despite the fact that infections have long been associated with MS development. Current data suggest that infectious triggers are most likely ubiquitous, i.e., highly prevalent in the general population, and that they require a permissive genetic trait which predisposes for MS development. In this review article, we illustrate mechanisms of infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation, discuss challenges for the translation of these experimental data into human immunology research, and provide future perspectives on how novel model systems could be utilized to better define the role of viral pathogens in MS.","meta":{"paper_id":"c9e7f5a8995f8967153bfa9c2a37d99ecadd7a5d","title":"Viral triggers of multiple sclerosis"}}
{"text":"To date there is no effective treatment for bovine cryptosporidiosis. This study describes the use of halofuginone lactate in preventing cryptosporidiosis in naturally infected neonatal calves on a dairy farm with a high prevalence of infection. The animals were kept in two different calf rearing systems. A randomized double-blind trial was carried out with 32 naturally infected calves, divided into four groups. The two prophylactic halofuginone lactate treated groups were kept in either individual or group pens. Similarly, the animals receiving the placebo were housed in either individual pens or together in a large pen. A total of ten faecal samples were collected periodically during the 28 days study from each calf and tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium spp. using microscopic and molecular methods. Generalized estimating equations models were used to determine if the effects of the various treatments and\/or rearing systems on the presence of diarrhoea and infection were statistically significant. Further analysis (classification trees models) was carried out to explore possible risk factors for cryptosporidiosis and interactions between treatments and rearing systems. Halofuginone lactate was shown to be effective in reducing clinical signs of cryptosporidiosis and environmental contamination. However, the treatment did not delay the onset of diarrhoea and did not reduce the risk of infection amongst calves reared together in a highly contaminated environment. The use of halofuginone lactate in combination with good hygienic measures, such as rearing animals in clean individual pens, was the most effective method to reduce the risk of cryptosporidiosis amongst 7-13 days old calves. It was concluded that the control of the parasite could be achieved by the combination of using effective preventive drugs, such as halofuginone lactate and good animal husbandry procedures.","meta":{"paper_id":"f592a8a27662ba15bf4af4b3bdb0e71c3dc0e88e","title":"Control of cryptosporidiosis in neonatal calves: Use of halofuginone lactate in two different calf rearing systems"}}

Abstract Community-acquired pneumonias are major causes of hospitalization and death. Immediate assessment of severity, based on accurate clinical criteria, is an important step for rapid intensive care management and control of organ failures. Appropriate microbiological sampling should be performed prior to the antimicrobial therapy that should be initiated promptly after the diagnostic. Despite identification techniques, only 50% of community-acquired pneumonia cases are documented. Antibio therapy is initially empirical. The goal is to provide optimal therapy for the most commonly identified causes of lethal pneumonia: extracellular and intracellular pathogens. A therapeutic regimen with a b-lactam combined with a macrolide or a fluoroquinolone is recommended. This combination should be always active against pneumococci. Despite increased pneumococcal penicillin resistance, the recent recommendations are not modified. Respiratory fluoroquinolones may be an alternative in case of major increase of pneumococcal resistance to b-lactams. In some special populations, with regard to underlying structural disease of the lung and other risk factors, Pseudomonas aeruginosa must be taken into account. The severity of some community-acquired pneumonias necessitates the use of adjunctive treatments. Reassessment should be undertaken 72 hours after initiation of therapy in order to evaluate the response to treatment, to simplify or to readapt the empirical treatment. Unjustified continuation of wide spectrum antibiotics leads to adverse events and widespread of bacterial resistance. The poor outcome of severe pneumonias justifies research on initial process of care and new therapeutics.","meta":{"paper_id":"1bc049b8dc09a80fd35d6aacbfda2b80e5f41b2b","title":"Pneumonies communautaires graves de l'adulte Severe community-acquired pneumonia in adults"}}

We investigated the etiology of a cluster of NEC in a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit and monitored for new cases following the implementation of enhanced infection control measures. Methods: Investigators performed a chart and laboratory review for neonates with a diagnosis of NEC during , to identify risk factors. Enhanced environmental cleaning, cohorting of infants and nurses, and increased attention to hand hygiene were instituted. Commercial feeding products in the unit were tested for bacterial contamination. Close monitoring for new cases continued for 2 months following the identification of the cluster. Results: Eleven cases of NEC were identified during the study period. Patients had a median of 5 disease risk factors (range, 3-8). Four distinct pathogens were detected in blood or stool specimens from 4 different patients. One sample of human milk fortifier (HMF) tested contained a colony count of Bacillus cereus at the US Food and Drug Administration's upper microbiologic limit for contamination. Seven (65%) patients received HMF before symptom onset, and 9 (82%) patients received 1 or more types of liquid formula. Only 1 new case was identified during the period of close monitoring. Conclusion: A microbiologic cause was not identified, and, although the cluster might have resolved spontaneously, enhanced infection control and changing batches of HMF might have played a role in controlling this outbreak.","meta":{"paper_id":"3137e6b6910babf168d2ec65a8dd8b0b1b693fbb","title":""}}
{"text":"Background: During outbreaks of infectious diseases, transmission of the pathogen can form networks of infected individuals connected either directly or indirectly. Methods: Network centrality metrics were used to characterize hospital-acquired Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (HA-MERS) outbreaks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2016. Covariate-adjusted multivariable logistic regression models were applied to assess the effect of individual level risk factors and network level metrics associated with increase in length of hospital stay and risk of deaths from MERS. Results: About 27% of MERS cases were hospital acquired during the study period. The median age of healthcare workers and hospitalized patients were 35 years and 63 years, respectively, Although HA-MERS were more connected, we found no significant difference in degree centrality metrics between HA-MERS and non-HA-MERS cases. Pre-existing medical conditions (adjusted Odds ratio (aOR) = 2.43, 95% confidence interval: (CI) [1.11-5.33]) and hospitalized patients (aOR = 29.99, 95% CI [1.80-48.65]) were the strongest risk predictors of death from MERS. The risk of death associated with 1-day increased length of stay was significantly higher for patients with comorbidities. Conclusion: Our investigation also revealed that patients with an HA-MERS infection experienced a significantly longer hospital stay and were more likely to die from the disease. Healthcare worker should be reminded of their potential role as hubs for pathogens because of their proximity to and regular interaction with infected patients. On the other hand, this study has shown that while healthcare workers acted as epidemic attenuators, hospitalized patients played the role of an epidemic amplifier.","meta":{"paper_id":"a18d8c68591f272a53e17dc1be216e0cab1749d0","title":"Individual and network characteristic associated with hospital-acquired Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus"}}
{"text":"Background China has undergone rapid demographic and epidemiological changes in the past few decades, including striking declines in fertility and child mortality and increases in life expectancy at birth. Popular discontent with the health system has led to major reforms. To help inform these reforms, we did a comprehensive assessment of disease burden in China, how it changed between 1990 and 2010, and how China's health burden compares with other nations. We assessed relative performance of China against G20 countries (signifi cantly better, worse, or indistinguishable from the G20 mean) with age-standardised rates and 95% uncertainty intervals. Findings The leading causes of death in China in 2010 were stroke (1\u00b77 million deaths, 95% UI 1\u00b75-1\u00b78 million), ischaemic heart disease (948 700 deaths, 774 500-1 024 600), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (934 000 deaths, 846 600-1 032 300). Age-standardised YLLs in China were lower in 2010 than all emerging economies in the G20, and only slightly higher than noted in the USA. China had the lowest age-standardised YLD rate in the G20 in 2010. China also ranked tenth (95% UI eighth to tenth) for HALE and 12th (11th to 13th) for life expectancy. YLLs from neonatal causes, infectious diseases, and injuries in children declined substantially between 1990 and 2010. Mental and behavioural disorders, substance use disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders were responsible for almost half of all YLDs. The fraction of DALYs from YLDs rose from 28\u00b71% (95% UI 24\u00b72-32\u00b75) in 1990 to 39\u00b74% (34\u00b79-43\u00b78) in 2010. Leading causes of DALYs in 2010 were cardiovascular diseases (stroke and ischaemic heart disease), cancers (lung and liver cancer), low back pain, and depression. Dietary risk factors, high blood pressure, and tobacco exposure are the risk factors that constituted the largest number of attributable DALYs in China. Ambient air pollution ranked fourth (third to fi fth; the second highest in the G20) and household air pollution ranked fi fth (fourth to sixth; the third highest in the G20) in terms of the age-standardised DALY rate in 2010. Interpretation The rapid rise of non-communicable diseases driven by urbanisation, rising incomes, and ageing poses major challenges for China's health system, as does a shift to chronic disability. Reduction of population exposures from poor diet, high blood pressure, tobacco use, cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose are public policy priorities for China, as are the control of ambient and household air pollution. These changes will require an integrated government response to improve primary care and undertake required multisectoral action to tackle key risks. Analyses of disease burden provide a useful framework to guide policy responses to the changing disease spectrum in China.","meta":{"paper_id":"4fc4f9a9cd5ad9dbea7dda843ea503f5c2f2b734","title":"fi ndings from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010"}}

The present study focused on prevention against the main infectious causes of neonatal calf diarrhoea i.e. Escherichia coli, rota-and coronavirus, and Cryptosporidium parvum. Dairy herds (n = 24) with a high percentage of neonatal calves scouring (>10%) were included and calves were sampled for the presence of these four enteropathogens. To decrease diarrhoea problems among neonatal calves, a standard protocol was tested on 13 herds (treatment group) where both C. parvum and either E. coli or rota-or coronavirus were identified as being involved, the other 11 herds served as control group. The protocol consisted of 2 points of action: preventive vaccination of dams against E. coli, rota-and coronavirus, and preventive administration of halofuginone lactate to newborn calves. The average percentage of calves suffering from neonatal diarrhoea (39.7% versus 14.3%, P < 0.01) and the average percentage of faecal samples positive for C. parvum (34% versus 11%, P < 0.05) differed significantly between control herds and treatment herds after implementation of the protocol. No significant differences between control and treatment group were observed in the percentage of calves excreting E. coli, rotavirus and coronavirus, both before and at the end of the trial. Furthermore, risk factors potentially associated with the development of neonatal calf scours were determined. Non-significant results were obtained for the effect of the protocol on duration of diarrhoea and the effect of the colostral IgG quantity on the risk of diarrhoea. Passive immunity transfer status of the calves, measured both before the onset and at the end of the study, were non-significant between groups.","meta":{"paper_id":"67a0f64c9c67cfa1a964dd1aa3490583ff1081e4","title":"Evaluation of a protocol to reduce the incidence of neonatal calf diarrhoea on dairy herds"}}

The conundrum remains as to whether EBV is directly involved in the pathophysiology of MS, or alternatively if the immunopathology of MS somehow affects the regulation of EBV infection.","meta":{"paper_id":"0d5c950f77a1ac543d72adf1323703d0d0134c9f","title":"Viral pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis: A role for Epstein-Barr virus infection?"}}

{"text":"Background: Acute respiratory infections are the leading cause of mortality in children worldwide, especially in developing countries. Pneumonia accounts for 16% of all deaths of children under 5 years of age and was the cause of death of 935 000 children in 2015. Despite its frequency and severity, information regarding its etiology is limited. The aim of this study was to identify respiratory viruses associated with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children younger than 5 years old. Methods: One thousand four hundred and four children younger than 5 years of age with a clinical and\/or radiological diagnosis of CAP in 11 hospitals in Mexico were included. Nasal washes were collected, placed in viral medium, and frozen at \u00c070 C until processing. The first 832 samples were processed using the multiplex Bio-Plex\/Luminex system and the remaining 572 samples using the Anyplex multiplex RT-PCR. Clinical data regarding diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic pattern, and risk factors were obtained and recorded. Results: Of the samples tested, 81.6% were positive for viruses. Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B) was found in 23.7%, human enterovirus\/rhinovirus in 16.6%, metapneumovirus in 5.7%, parainfluenza virus (types 1-4) in 5.5%, influenza virus (types A and B) in 3.6%, adenovirus in 2.2%, coronavirus (NL63, OC43, 229E, and HKU1) in 2.2%, and bocavirus in 0.4%. Co-infection with two or more viruses was present in 22.1%; 18.4% of the samples were negative. Using biomass for cooking, daycare attendance, absence of breastfeeding, and co-infections were found to be statistically significant risk factors for the presence of severe pneumonia. Conclusions: Respiratory syncytial virus (types A and B), human enterovirus\/rhinovirus, and metapneumovirus were the respiratory viruses identified most frequently in children younger than 5 years old with CAP. Co-infection was present in an important proportion of the children.","meta":{"paper_id":"43e6e8580066e1b1cc44c816885e2b6262c2f7f7","title":""}}

Molecular analysis utilising nested RT-PCR assay targeting the L gene of FeMV performed on either urine, blood and\/or kidney samples collected from 208 cats in this study revealed 82 (39.4%) positive cats. FeMV-positive samples were obtained from 63\/124 (50.8%) urine and 20\/25 (80.0%) kidneys while all blood samples were negative for FeMV. In addition, from the 35 cats that had more than one type of samples collected (blood and urine; blood and kidney; blood, urine and kidney), only one cat had FeMV RNA in the urine and kidney samples. Risk factors such as gender, presence of kidney-associated symptoms and cat source were also investigated. Male cats had a higher risk (p = 0.031) of FeMV infection than females. In addition, no significant association (p = 0.083) was observed between the presence of kidney-associated symptoms with FeMV status. From the 82 positive samples, FeMV RNA was detected from 48\/82 (58.5%) pet cats and 34\/126 (27.0%) shelter cats (p < 0.0001).

{"text":"The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for morbidity and mortality of bobby calves across the whole dairy supply chain in New Zealand. A case-control study was carried out in the 2016 spring calving season. A total of 194 bobby calves, comprising 38 cases (calves that died or were condemned for health or welfare reasons before the point of slaughter) and 156 controls (calves deemed acceptable and presented for slaughter) were included in the study. Case and control calves were selected by veterinarians located at 29 processing premises across New Zealand. Information regarding management of selected calves on-farm, during transport and at the processor was obtained retrospectively via questionnaires administered to supplying farmers, transport operators and processing premises personnel. Associations between management variables and calf mortality (death or condemnation) were examined using multivariable logistic regression models. Factors associated with an increased risk of calf mortality included time in the farm of origin's calving season, duration of travel from farm to the processor and processing slaughter schedule (same day or next day). Every additional week into the farm's calving season increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.2 (95%CI 1.06, 1.35). Similarly, each additional hour of travel time increased the odds of mortality by a factor of 1.45 (95% CI 1.18, 1.76). Risk of mortality was significantly greater for calves processed at premises with a next day slaughter schedule than those processed at premises with a same day slaughter schedule (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.51, 9.67). However, when the data set was limited to those cases that died or were condemned in the yards (i.e. excluding calves that were dead or condemned on arrival) the effect of same day slaughter was not significant. In order to reduce bobby calf mortality and morbidity, transport duration should be kept as short as possible and a same day slaughter schedule applied. While these factors can be regulated, New Zealand's pastoral dairy system means that calves will inevitably be transported for slaughter across several months each spring. Although farm management factors did not apparently influence the risk of mortality in this study, the effect of time in farm's calving season suggests there may be farm-management related factors that change over the season. This requires further investigation.","meta":{"paper_id":"d7ff69edc7eb8d1fc0e31314b8a4434a50a31134","title":"Risk factors for bobby calf mortality across the New Zealand dairy supply chain"}}

{"text":"Even though bronchiolitis is a disease that has been recognized for many years, there are still few therapeutic strategies beyond supportive therapies. Bronchiolitis is the most frequent cause of hospital admission in children less than 1 year of age. The incidence is estimated to be about 150\u00b0million cases a year worldwide, and 2-3% of these cases require hospitalization. It is acknowledged that viruses cause bronchiolitis, but most of the studies focus on RSV. The RSV causes a more severe form of bronchiolitis in children with risk factors including prematurity, cardiovascular disease and immunodeficiency. Other viruses involved in causing bronchiolitis include RV, hMPV, hBoV and co-infections. The RV seems to be associated with a less severe acute disease, but there is a correlation between the early infection and subsequent wheezing bronchitis and asthma in later childhood and adulthood. The supportive therapies used are intravenous fluids and oxygen supplement administered by nasal cannula or CPAP in most complicated patients. Additional pharmacological therapies include epinephrine, 3% hypertonic saline and corticosteroids. The Epinephrine seems to have the greatest short-term benefits and reduces the need of hospital admission, whereas hypertonic saline and corticosteroids seem to reduce the length of hospital stay. As bronchiolitis is such a prevalent disease in children and RV seems to play an important role, perhaps more studies should center around the RV's contribution to the initial disease and following pathology.","meta":{"paper_id":"bb0c0c2b370334c1264308db5150084813aa561a","title":"Viral bronchiolitis in children: A common condition with few therapeutic options \u2606"}}

An increase in on-farm mortality (euthanasia and death) in dairy herds has been reported in several countries in the last decade. This does not only imply possible problems with animal welfare, but it also causes economic losses to the farmer. The objective of this study was to evaluate time trends in on-farm dairy cow mortality in Sweden and identify potential herd-level risk factors. Data were retrieved on all Swedish dairy herds enrolled in the milk recording scheme between 2002 and 2010. Herds with a herd size of <20 cows or a mortality rate (MR) of >40 dead or euthanized cows per 100 cow-years were excluded. Two different models were used: 1 multiple-year analysis, which included 6,898 herds during the period 2002 to 2010 and 1 single-year analysis including 4,252 herds for the year 2010, where other variables that were not present during the entire multiple year study were analyzed. The outcome variable was the number of euthanized and dead cows per year and season. A negative binomial regression model, adjusted for clustering within herd, was applied to both models. Fixed effects in the multiple-year analysis were breed, calving interval, herd size, milk yield, region, season, pasture period, and year. The fixed effects in the single-year analysis were breed, calving interval, conventional versus organic farming, herd size, housing system, milk yield, region, and season. The results demonstrated that MR gradually increased from 5.1 to 6.6 events per 100 cow-years during the study period. Swedish MR are consequently on par with, or even greater than, MR among dairy herds in other comparable countries. Higher mortality was associated with larger herd size, longer calving intervals, and herds that had Swedish Holstein as the predominant breed. Lower mortality was observed in herds with a higher herd average milk yield, during the fall and winter, and in organically managed herds. There were regional differences in mortality. An interaction between herd size and season was found in both models. Also, an interaction between housing system and milk yield was found in the single-year analysis. This first assessment of on-farm mortality in Swedish dairy herds confirmed that the MR has increased over the last few years. The study also identified some herd-level risk factors.","meta":{"paper_id":"3ef6e6e952b66be4c95401c58c1ca45254fadc82","title":"ON-FARM MORTALITY IN SWEDISH DAIRY COWS 4354 ALV\u00c5SEN ET AL"}}

There are no randomized controlled trials on the effect of systemic corticosteroids in patients with this disease. Objective: We sought to study the short-and long-term effects of prednisolone treatment of the first acute, moderate-to-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode in young children. Methods: After confirming rhinovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate by using PCR, 79 children with a first wheezing episode at age 3 to 23 months were randomized to receive oral prednisolone (first dose of 2 mg\/kg, followed by 2 mg\/kg\/d in 2 divided doses for 3 days) or placebo. The trial was double blind throughout the 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were long term: new physician-confirmed wheezing episode within 2 months, number of physician-confirmed wheezing episodes within 12 months, and initiation of regular controller medication for asthma symptoms within 12 months. The primary interaction analysis examined rhinovirus load. Results: Seventy-four patients completed the study (mean age, 13 months; 28% atopic). Long-term outcomes did not differ between groups (all P > _ .30). For short-term outcomes, the prednisolone group had less cough, rhinitis, noisy breathing, severe breathing difficulties, and nocturnal respiratory symptoms at home within 2 weeks (all P < .05). The 25 children with greater than 7000 rhinovirus copies\/mL (most sensitive cutoff) benefitted from prednisolone in terms of less risk of physician-confirmed recurrence within 2 and 12 months compared with placebo (both P < .05). Conclusions: Prednisolone cannot be routinely recommended for all young children experiencing their first acute, moderateto-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode.

{"text":"Background: Lower respiratory tract infections in the first years of life are associated with later asthma, and this observation has led to a focus on the potential causal role of specific respiratory viruses, such as rhinoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus, in asthma development. However, many respiratory viruses and bacteria trigger similar respiratory symptoms and it is possible that the important risk factors for asthma are the underlying susceptibility to infection and the exaggerated reaction to such triggers rather than the particular triggering agent. Objective: We sought to study the association between specific infections in early life and development of asthma later in childhood. Methods: Three hundred thirteen children were followed prospectively in the Copenhagen Prospective Studies of Asthma in Childhood 2000 high-risk birth cohort. Nine respiratory virus types (respiratory syncytial virus, rhinoviruses, other picornaviruses, coronaviruses 229E and OC43, parainfluenza viruses 1-3, influenza viruses AH1, AH3, and B, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus) and 3 pathogenic airway bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis) were identified in airway secretions sampled during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms in the first 3 years of life. Asthma was determined by age 7 years. Results: In unadjusted analyses, all viruses and pathogenic bacteria identified during episodes of troublesome lung symptoms were associated with increased risk of asthma by age 7 years with similar odds ratios for all viruses and pathogenic bacteria. After adjustment for the frequency of respiratory episodes, the particular triggers were no longer associated with asthma. Conclusion: The number of respiratory episodes in the first years of life, but not the particular viral trigger, was associated with later asthma development. This suggests that future research should focus on the susceptibility and exaggerated response to lower respiratory tract infections in general rather than on the specific triggering agent.

{"text":"Background: There is good evidence that air pollution is a risk factor for adverse respiratory and vascular health outcomes. However, data are limited as to whether ambient fine particles contribute to the transmission of influenza and if so, how the association is modified by weather conditions. Objectives: We examined the relationship between ambient PM 2.5 and influenza incidence at the national level in China and explored the associations at different temperatures. Methods: Daily data on concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter b 2.5 \u03bcm (PM 2.5 ) and influenza incidence counts were collected in 47 Chinese cities. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the city-specific PM 2.5 -influenza association, after controlling for potential confounders. Then, a random-effect metaanalysis was used to pool the effects at national level. In addition, stratified analyses were performed to examine modification effects of ambient temperature. Results: For single lag models, the highest effect of ambient PM 2.5 on influenza incidence appeared at lag day 2, with relative risk (RR) of 1.015 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.004, 1.025) associated with a 10 \u03bcg\/m 3 increase in PM 2.5 . For moving average lag models, the significant association was found at lag 2-3 days, with RR of 1.020 (95% CI: 1.006, 1.034). The RR of influenza transmission associated with PM 2.5 was higher for cold compared with hot days. Overall, 10.7% of incident influenza cases may result from exposure to ambient PM 2.5 .

{"text":"Neonatal diarrhea is one of the most important syndromes in dairy cattle. Among enteropathogens, Cryptosporidium spp. are primary causes of diarrhea, but outbreaks due to cryptosporidiosis are rarely reported in cattle. From January to April in 2016, severe diarrhea was observed in over 400 neonatal dairy calves on a large dairy farm in Jiangsu Province of East China. Approximately 360 calves died due to watery diarrhea despite antibiotic therapy. In this study, 18 fecal specimens were collected from seriously ill calves on this farm during the diarrhea outbreak, and analysed for common enteropathogens by enzymatic immunoassay (EIA). In a post-outbreak investigation, 418 and 1372 specimens collected from animals of various age groups were further analysed for rotavirus and Cryptosporidium spp. by EIA and PCR, respectively, to assess their roles in the occurrence of diarrhea on the farm. Cryptosporidium spp. were genotyped using established techniques. Initial EIA tests showed that 15\/18 seriously ill calves during the outbreak were positive for Cryptosporidium parvum, while 8\/18 were positive for rotavirus. The overall infection rate of Cryptosporidium in pre-weaned calves on the farm was 22.7%, with odds of the Cryptosporidium infection during the outbreak 4.4-23.5 times higher than after the outbreak. Four Cryptosporidium spp. were identified after the outbreak including C. parvum (n = 79), Cryptosporidium ryanae (n = 48), Cryptosporidium bovis (n = 31), and Cryptosporidium andersoni (n = 3), with co-infections of multiple species being detected in 34 animals. Infection with C. parvum (73\/79) was found in the majority of calves aged 3 weeks, consistent with the age of ill calves during the outbreak. All C. parvum isolates were identified as subtype IIdA19G1. In the post-outbreak investigation, C. parvum infection was associated with the occurrence of watery diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, C. ryanae infection was associated with moderate diarrhea in both pre-and post-weaned calves, while no association was identified between rotavirus infection and the occurrence of diarrhea. Results of logistic regression analysis further suggested that C. bovis infection might also be a risk factor for moderate diarrhea in calves. Thus, we believe this is the first report of a major outbreak of severe diarrhea caused by C. parvum IIdA19G1 in dairy calves.

We identifi ed all patients and health-care workers who had been in the emergency room with the index case between May 27 and May 29, 2015. Patients were categorised on the basis of their exposure in the emergency room: in the same zone as the index case (group A), in diff erent zones except for overlap at the registration area or the radiology suite (group B), and in diff erent zones (group C). We documented cases of MERS-CoV infection, confi rmed by real-time PCR testing of sputum samples. We analysed attack rates, incubation periods of the virus, and risk factors for transmission. After excluding nine cases (because of inability to determine the date of symptom onset in six cases and lack of data from three visitors), the median incubation period was 7 days (range 2-17, IQR 5-10). The median incubation period was signifi cantly shorter in group A than in group C (5 days [IQR 4-8] vs 11 days [6-12]; p<0\u00b70001). There were no confi rmed cases in patients and visitors who visited the emergency room on May 29 and who were exposed only to potentially contaminated environment without direct contact with the index case. The main risk factor for transmission of MERS-CoV was the location of exposure. Interpretation Our results showed increased transmission potential of MERS-CoV from a single patient in an overcrowded emergency room and provide compelling evidence that health-care facilities worldwide need to be prepared for emerging infectious diseases.","meta":{"paper_id":"8b26d388f3be5fe51add155cfc19c9aae9bf9b87","title":"MERS-CoV outbreak following a single patient exposure in an emergency room in South Korea: an epidemiological outbreak study"}}
{"text":"Background: Approximately half of the reported laboratory-confirmed infections of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have occurred in healthcare settings, and healthcare workers constitute over one third of all secondary infections. This study aimed to describe secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare workers and to identify risk factors for death. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on epidemiological data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization from September 2012 to 2 June 2018. We compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non-healthcare workers. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for death. Results: Of the 2223 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non-healthcare workers. Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P < 0.001), more likely to be female (P < 0.001), non-nationals (P < 0.001) and asymptomatic (P < 0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P < 0.001) and higher rates of survival (P < 0.001). Year of infection (2013-2018) and having no comorbidities were independent protective factors against death among secondary healthcare workers cases. Conclusion: Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcareassociated outbreaks. By extension, reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities.","meta":{"paper_id":"5ec1bf2fc5d286672feb316e70accdd302d7ed50","title":"Hazard Management, WHO Health Emergencies Programme, World Health Organization"}}

{"text":"Calf diarrhea is one of the most important problems in calf rearing on dairy farms worldwide. Besides pathogens, several noninfectious management factors, especially management around birth, colostrum management, calf housing, feeding, and hygiene are important in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. To date, few data are available concerning calf rearing management on small and medium-sized dairy farms that are typical for Austria and the alpine region. Consequently, the objectives of this case-control study were to evaluate routine calf management practices on Austrian dairy farms and to examine differences in management between farms with and without the presence of calf diarrhea to identify risk factors. Overall, 100 dairy farms were visited. Of these farms, 50 were chosen based on the history and presence of calf diarrhea (case farms). Another 50 farms with no presence of calf diarrhea were chosen to serve as a standard of comparison (control farms). On farms, management was evaluated by face-to-face interview, and health status and hygiene were surveyed. Several calf rearing management procedures were similar on all of the visited farms, especially in areas regulated by national and European law. These factors include colostrum management and feeding. Consequently, no influence of these factors on the appearance of calf diarrhea could be detected. In contrast, other areas such as hygiene measures differed between farms and showed a partial association with the presence of calf diarrhea on farm. Variables related to diarrhea on farm were farm size; that is, the number of cows on farm. Farms with diarrhea cases were larger (median 40 cows, interquartile range 24.5 to 64.0) compared with farms with no presence of diarrhea (median 28 cows, interquartile range 18.8 to 44.0). Other risk factors that influenced the presence of diarrhea were the presence of other farm animal species on the farm [odds ratio (OR) 26.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.64 to 273.5], frequency of cleaning of the calving area (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.79), the placement of individual calf housings (barn vs. outdoors; OR 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.47), and the presence of respiratory tract disease (OR 52.49, 95% CI: 1.26 to 2,181.83).

{"text":"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are an important cause of the considerable morbidity and mortality found in COPD. COPD exacerbations increase with increasing severity of COPD, and some patients are prone to frequent exacerbations leading to hospital admission and readmission. These frequent exacerbations may have considerable impact on quality of life and activities of daily living. Factors that increase the risk for COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway inflammation caused by common pollutants and bacterial and\/or viral infections. These inflammatory responses cause mucus hypersecretion and, thereby, airway obstruction and associated exacerbations. While chronic mucus hypersecretion is a significant risk factor for frequent and severe exacerbations, patients with chronic mucus hypersecretion have a lower rate of relapse after initial treatment for acute exacerbation. The benefit of antibiotics for treatment of COPD exacerbations is small but significant. While the mechanisms of actions are not clear, mucolytic agents reduce the number of days of disability in subjects with exacerbations. Reducing mucous cell numbers in small airways could be a useful way to reduce chronic mucus hypersecretion. Our studies suggest that programmed cell death is crucial in the resolution of metaplastic mucous cells, and understanding these mechanisms may provide novel therapies to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations.","meta":{"paper_id":"860ba42a414be56d8892be78865f939fcd3fb2e9","title":"Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic mucus hypersecretion"}}

For patients at risk of asthma, or with existing asthma, viral respiratory tract infections can have a profound eff ect on the expression of disease or loss of control. New evidence has shown that wheezing episodes early in life due to human rhinoviruses are a major risk factor for the later diagnosis of asthma at age 6 years. For those with existing asthma, exacerbations are a major cause of morbidity, can need acute care, and can, albeit rarely, result in death. Viral respiratory tract infections, predominantly those caused by human rhinoviruses, are associated with asthma exacerbations. There is also evidence that defi ciencies in antiviral activity and the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier could make individuals with asthma more likely to have severe viral respiratory infections of the lower airway, and thus increase the risk of exacerbation.

{"text":"a gradual increase in on-farm mortality of Dutch veal calves was observed. In 2012, the cattle industry decided that more information was needed on risk factors for mortality in both veal herds and herds of origin to enable implementation of risk mitigating measures. Routinely collected data were available from seven different data sources and contained information from 2.4 million white veal calves that were fattened in the period between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2014. Survival analysis techniques (Kaplan-Meier), multilevel Poisson and multilevel Logistic regression models were applied to analyse the data. Two different models were assembled in which risk factors for veal calf mortality in respectively veal herds and herds of origin were identified. Univariable and multivariable regression techniques were used to detect risk factors significantly associated with mortality of veal calves during the fattening period. During the study period, the mean mortality was 4.9% per production cycle. The probability to die was highest during the first weeks after arrival in the veal herds and declined thereafter. Important risk factors included a veal herds with a higher use of antimicrobials, hair colour as proxy for breed, certain countries of origin, veal herd management with a limited amount of supplied feed and a not having an all-in \/ all-out system. A higher body weight at arrival in the veal herd was associated with lower mortality as well as veal calves that were fed an above median amount of milk, roughage and concentrates. From the calves that were fattened during the study period, observations of 1.1 million calves originated from the Netherlands and were available to study risk factors for veal calf mortality associated with the herd of origin. Important risk factors included purchase, herds with high mortality rates in the quarter in which the calf was born, fast growth in herd size, high cattle replacement rates and a higher antibiotic use in the quarter of birth. Calves that originated from herds that were certified BVD-free, Salmonella-unsuspected or Paratuberculosis-unsuspected, had a lower odds to die during the subsequent fattening period in a veal herd. Veal calf mortality was influenced by risk factors at the herd of origin as well as at veal herds. Adequate collaboration between the different industries is necessary to optimize veal calf management leading to a reduction in veal calf mortality during the fattening period. (I.M.G.A.

{"text":"Tropical countries are experiencing a substantial rise in type 2 diabetes, which is often undiagnosed or poorly controlled. Since diabetes is a risk factor for many infectious diseases, this increase probably adds to the large infectious disease burden in tropical countries. We reviewed the literature to investigate the interface between diabetes and infections in tropical countries, including the WHO-defined neglected tropical diseases. Although solid data are sparse, patients with diabetes living in tropical countries most likely face increased risks of common and health-care-associated infections, as well as infected foot ulcers, which often lead to amputation. There is strong evidence that diabetes increases the severity of some endemic infections such as tuberculosis, melioidosis, and dengue virus infection. Some HIV and antiparasitic drugs might induce diabetes, whereas helminth infections appear to afford some protection against future diabetes. But there are no or very scarce data for most tropical infections and for possible biological mechanisms underlying associations with diabetes. The rise in diabetes and other non-communicable diseases puts a heavy toll on health systems in tropical countries. On the other hand, complications common to both diabetes and some tropical infections might provide an opportunity for shared services-for example, for eye health (trachoma and onchocerciasis), ulcer care (leprosy), or renal support (schistosomiasis). More research about the interaction of diabetes and infections in tropical countries is needed, and the infectious disease burden in these countries is another reason to step up global efforts to improve prevention and care for diabetes.

Birth season was dichotomized into summer and winter using meteorological data collected by University of Florida Agricultural Research Stations. Health data including date of initial treatment and number of treatments were collected for the diseases diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia. All calves were followed for 6 months. Cumulative incidences of mortality and occurrence of diarrhea, omphalitis, septicemia and pneumonia were 0.12, 0.35, 0.11, 0.24 and 0.21, respectively.

The hazard mortality ratio was constant from birth to six months, indicating that the increased risk of mortality associated with low levels of TP was evident through six months of age.

Objectives: To characterize a nosocomial hMPV outbreak during the 2003 SARS epidemic. Study design and methods: All available nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) collected from confirmed patients during the first 8 weeks of the SARS outbreak in 2003 were tested for hMPV by a nested RT-PCR assay targeting the F-gene. Clinico-epidemiological information was used to analyze the relationship of hMPV co-infection to specific risk factors (demographics\/symptoms\/outcomes; status as health-care workers (HCWs)\/patients; history of exposure\/contact; ward location). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors.

Of the sampled herds, 101 (25.8%) had sow seroprevalences of at least 80%, 79 (20.1%) had seroprevalences between 10 and 79%, and 212 (54.1%) were seronegative. For evaluation of risk factors for TGE seropositivity, analysis was restricted to herds with at least five tested sows and either 0% or at least 20% seropositive sows. In the logistic regression analysis, a herd was considered seropositive if at least 20% of sampled females had titers of 1:8 or higher (n = 160), and a herd was seronegative if all females had titers of under I:8 (n = 178). Factors considered for inclusion in logistic regression models included breeding herd size, biosecurity measures, pig introductions and movements, and access of possible nonporcine reservoirs to the facilities with pigs. After controlling for the effects of season, number of samples tested and TGE vaccination history, large female breeding herd size (at least 500 sows compared with the reference category of 100-199 sows) and purchase of more than 25 pigs from non-specific pathogen free (SPF) herds were associated with significantly (P < 0.05) higher odds of herd seropositivity (odds ratios 4.9 and 3.9, respectively).

{"text":"More than thirty years have passed since canine parvovirus (CPV) emerged as a significant pathogen and it continues to pose a severe threat to world canine populations. Published information suggests that flies (Diptera) may play a role in spreading this virus; however, they have not been studied extensively and the degree of their involvement is not known. This investigation was directed toward evaluating the vector capacity of such flies and determining their potential role in the transmission and ecology of CPV. Molecular diagnostic methods were used in this cross-sectional study to detect the presence of CPV in flies trapped at thirty-eight canine facilities. The flies involved were identified as belonging to the house fly (Mucidae), flesh fly (Sarcophagidae) and blow\/bottle fly (Calliphoridae) families. A primary surveillance location (PSL) was established at a canine facility in south-central South Carolina, USA, to identify fly-virus interaction within the canine facility environment. Flies trapped at this location were pooled monthly and assayed for CPV using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. These insects were found to be positive for CPV every month from February through the end of November 2011. Fly vector behavior and seasonality were documented and potential environmental risk factors were evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted to compare the mean numbers of each of the three fly families captured, and after determining fly CPV status (positive or negative), it was determined whether there were significant relationships between numbers of flies captured, seasonal numbers of CPV cases, temperature and rainfall. Flies were also sampled at thirty-seven additional canine facility surveillance locations (ASL) and at four non-canine animal industry locations serving as negative field controls. Canine facility risk factors were identified and evaluated. Statistical analyses were conducted on the number of CPV cases reported within the past year to determine the correlation of fly CPV status (positive or negative) for each facility, facility design (open or closed), mean number of dogs present monthly and number of flies captured.

{"text":"Human interaction with animals has been implicated as a primary risk factor for several high impact zoonoses, including many bat-origin viral diseases. However the animal-to-human spillover events that lead to emerging diseases are rarely observed or clinically examined, and the link between specific interactions and spillover risk is poorly understood. To investigate this phenomenon, we conducted biological-behavioral surveillance among rural residents in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong districts of Southern China, where we have identified a number of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats. Serum samples were tested for four bat-borne coronaviruses using newly developed enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Survey data were used to characterize associations between human-animal contact and bat coronavirus spillover risk. A total of 1,596 residents were enrolled in the study from 2015 to 2017. Nine participants (0.6%) tested positive for bat coronaviruses. 265 (17%) participants reported severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and\/or influenza-like illness (ILI) symptoms in the past year, which were associated with poultry, carnivore, rodent\/shrew, or bat contact, with variability by family income and district of residence. This study provides serological evidence of bat coronavirus spillover in rural communities in Southern China. The low seroprevalence observed in this study suggests that bat coronavirus spillover is a rare event. Nonetheless, this study highlights associations between human-animal interaction and zoonotic spillover risk. These findings can be used to support targeted biological behavioral surveillance in high-risk geographic areas in order to reduce the risk of zoonotic disease emergence.","meta":{"paper_id":"4f5c01b714e95fe977701645bfad1f814a20faa5","title":"Human-animal interactions and bat coronavirus spillover potential among rural residents in Southern China-NC-ND license (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-nd\/4.0\/)"}}

{"text":"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are considered widespread among cattle in Norway and worldwide. This cross-sectional study was conducted based on antibody-ELISA of bulk tank milk (BTM) from 1347 herds in two neighboring counties in western Norway. The study aims were to determine the seroprevalence at herd level, to evaluate risk factors for BRSV and BCoV seropositivity, and to assess how these factors were associated with the spatial distribution of positive herds. The overall prevalence of BRSV and BCoV positive herds in the region was 46.2% and 72.2%, respectively. Isopleth maps of the prevalence risk distribution showed large differences in prevalence risk across the study area, with the highest prevalence in the northern region. Common risk factors of importance for both viruses were herd size, geographic location, and proximity to neighbors. Seropositivity for one virus was associated with increased odds of seropositivity for the other virus. Purchase of livestock was an additional risk factor for BCoV seropositivity, included in the model as in-degree, which was defined as the number of incoming movements from individual herds, through animal purchase, over a period of five years. Local dependence and the contribution of risk factors to this effect were assessed using the residuals from two logistic regression models for each virus. One model contained only the xand y-coordinates as predictors, the other had all significant predictors included. Spatial clusters of high values of residuals were detected using the normal model of the spatial scan statistic and visualized on maps. Adjusting for the risk factors in the final models had different impact on the spatial clusters for the two viruses: For BRSV the number of clusters was reduced from six to four, for BCoV the number of clusters remained the same, however the log-likelihood ratios changed notably. This indicates that geographical differences in proximity to neighbors, herd size and animal movements explain some of the spatial clusters of BRSV-and BCoV seropositivity, but far from all. The remaining local dependence in the residuals show that the antibody status of one herd is influenced by the antibody status of its neighbors, indicating the importance of indirect transmission and that increased biosecurity routines might be an important preventive strategy.","meta":{"paper_id":"ebc824ac4eef0e9f30adc378211f28f77e9fe5d9","title":"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine coronavirus antibodies in bulk tank milk -risk factors and spatial analysis-NC-ND license (http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-nd\/4.0\/)"}}

The chapter begins with the corporate obligation of \"duty of care\" and what that means at a fundamental level, and then provides examples of different kinds of risks that companies should think about and implement plans to address. There are an infinite number of potential use cases for risk exposure to travelers, but these examples provide good food for thought, in particular to those companies whose knee-jerk reactions to creating a TRM program is typically comments about their not necessarily needing one because they don't believe that they travel to high-risk destinations, which is a farce. As you will learn throughout this text, risk exposure is not always directly related to the risk rating of a particular destination as provided by risk intelligence providers. It can also be about risks that are specific to a traveler, their behavior and any number of other factors, some of which may be foreseeable, and some not. This information is important, but in the absence of a moderate to high risk rating, there is still the potential for an individual or widespread crisis that can affect groups of people and even an entire company.

{"text":"Respiratory tract infections (bovine respiratory disease) are a major concern in calf rearing. The objective of this study was to identify pathogen-specific risk factors associated with epidemic respiratory disease in calves. A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 128 outbreaks (29 dairy, 58 dairy-mixed, and 41 beef) in Belgium (2016Belgium ( -2018. A semiquantitative PCR for 7 respiratory pathogens was done on a pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample for each herd. Potential risk factors were collected by questionnaire and derived from the national cattle registration databank. Most outbreaks occurred between October and March, and single and multiple viral infections were detected in 58.6% (75\/128) and 13.3% (17\/128), respectively. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was the most frequently isolated virus (38.4%), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; 29.4%) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3; 8.1%). Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni were detected in 33.3, 41.2, 89.1, and 36.4% of the herds, respectively. Specific risk factors for BCV detection were detection of M. haemolytica [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-7.5)], increasing herd size [OR = 1.3 (1.0-1.8) for each increase with 100 animals] and detection of BCV by antigen ELISA on feces in calves in the last year [OR = 3.6 (1.2-11.1)]. A seasonal effect was shown for bRSV only {more in winter compared with autumn [OR = 10.3 (2.8-37.5)]}. Other factors associated with bRSV were PI-3 detection [OR = 13.4 (2.1-86.0)], prevalence of calves with respiratory disease [OR = 1.02 (1.00-1.04) per 1% increase], and number of days with respiratory signs before sampling [OR = 0.99 (0.98-0.99) per day increase]. Next to its association with BCV, M. haemolytica was more frequently detected in herds with 5 to 10 animals per pen [OR = 8.0 (1.4-46.9)] compared with <5 animals, and in herds with sawdust as bedding [OR = 18.3 (1.8-191.6)]. Also, for H. somni, housing on sawdust was a risk factor [OR = 5.2 (1.2-23.0)]. Purchase of cattle [OR = 2.9 (1.0-8.0)] and housing of recently purchased animals in the same airspace [OR = 5.0 (1.5-16.5)] were risk factors for M. bovis. This study identified pathogen-specific risk factors that might be useful for the development of customized control and prevention and for the design of decision support tools to justify antimicrobial use by predicting the most likely pathogen before sampling results are available.","meta":{"paper_id":"174b240f9833312df0f94609f19e908eaf7e285f","title":"Pathogen-specific risk factors in acute outbreaks of respiratory disease in calves"}}

{"text":"Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, many questions remain on modes of transmission and sources of virus. In outbreak situations, especially with emerging organisms causing severe human disease, it is important to understand the full spectrum of disease, and shedding kinetics in relation to infectivity and the ability to transmit the microorganism. Laboratory response capacity during the early stages of an outbreak focuses on development of virological and immunological methods for patient diagnosis, for contact tracing, and for epidemiological studies into sources, modes of transmission, identification of risk groups, and animal reservoirs. However, optimal use of this core public health laboratory capacity requires a fundamental understanding of kinetics of viral shedding and antibody response, of assay validation and of interpretation of test outcomes. We reviewed available data from MERS-CoV case reports, and compared this with data on kinetics of shedding and immune response from published literature on other human coronaviruses (hCoVs). We identify and discuss important data gaps, and biases that limit the laboratory preparedness to this novel disease. Public health management will benefit from standardised reporting of methods used, details of test outcomes by sample type, sampling date, in relation to symptoms and risk factors, along with the currently reported demographic, clinical and epidemiological findings.","meta":{"paper_id":"6eddf8d6260053b650b2734970140c9efe710ab9","title":"MERS coronavirus: Data gaps for laboratory preparedness"}}

Fecal samples were collected weekly for 4 weeks from each of 1045 calves under 30 days of age on 11 dairy farms in south-western Ontario during the summer of 2003 and the winter of 2004. A questionnaire designed to gather information on calf-level management factors was administered on farm for each calf in the study. Samples were examined for C. parvum oocysts by microscopy, and a subset of specimens was also tested for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Salmonella, bovine rotavirus and bovine coronavirus. The consistency of each sample was scored and recorded at the time of collection in order to assess the presence or absence of diarrhea. In addition, a blood sample was taken from each calf upon enrolment in the study, for assessment of maternal antibody transfer and for polymerase chain reaction testing for persistent bovine viral diarrhea virus infection. Using the GLLAMM function in Stata 9.0, multilevel regression techniques were employed to investigate associations between management practices and the risk of C. parvum shedding or diarrhea. C. parvum oocysts were detected in the feces of 78% of the 919 calves from which all four fecal samples had been collected. Furthermore, 73% of the 846 calves for which all four fecal consistency scores had been recorded were diarrheic at the time of collection of at least one sample. Significant predictors of the calflevel risk of C. parvum shedding included the use of calf diarrhea prophylaxis in pregnant cows, and the type of maternity facilities in which the calves were born.

{"text":"Background: Risk factors for acute wheezing among children in subtropical areas are largely unknown. Objective: To investigate the role of viral infections, allergen sensitization, and exposure to indoor allergens as risk factors for acute wheezing in children 0 to 12 years old. Methods: One hundred thirty-two children 0 to 12 years of age who sought emergency department care for wheezing and 65 children with no history of wheezing were enrolled in this case-control study. Detection of respiratory syncytial virus antigen, rhinovirus and coronavirus RNA, adenovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza antigens was performed in nasal washes. Total IgE and specific IgE to mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were measured with the CAP system. Major allergens from mites, cockroach, cat, and dog were quantified in dust samples by ELISA. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by logistic regression. Results: In children under 2 years of age, infection with respiratory viruses and family history of allergy were independently associated with wheezing (odds ratio, 15.5 and 4.2; P = .0001 and P = .008, respectively). Among children 2 to 12 years old, sensitization to inhalant allergens was the major risk factor for wheezing (odds ratio, 2.7; P = .03). High-level allergen exposure, exposure to tobacco smoke, and lack of breast-feeding showed no association with wheezing.

{"text":"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a T cell driven autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Despite its association with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV), how viral infections promote MS remains unclear. However, there is increasing evidence that the CNS is continuously surveyed by virus-specific T cells, which protect against reactivating neurotropic viruses. Here, we discuss how viral infections could lead to the breakdown of self-tolerance in genetically predisposed individuals, and how the reactivations of viruses in the CNS could induce the recruitment of both autoaggressive and virus-specific T cell subsets, causing relapses and progressive disability. A disturbed immune surveillance in MS would explain several experimental findings, and has important implications for prognosis and therapy. MS is the most common inflammatory autoimmune disorder of the CNS [1,2]. It is characterized by the destruction of the protective myelin sheath of neurons, resulting in macroscopic lesions in the brain and causing progressive disability. MS can be subdivided into relapsing-remitting (RR), primary progressive (PP) or secondary progressive (SP; i.e., the RR subtype worsening over time to SP-MS) forms. RR-MS is the dominant form at disease onset, and is characterized by acute clinical attacks followed by apparent disease stability. Symptoms can be alleviated with several therapies, but, in some patients, there is no beneficial effect and the disease may evolve to a SP form. PP-MS and SP-MS remain difficult to treat and are also mechanistically poorly understood [3] . The etiology of MS is still unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk of developing MS [1,2]. The major genetic risk factor maps to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene cluster, and the strongest risk is conferred by HLA-DRB1*15:01 in the class II region [4, 5] . The principal function of MHC class II proteins is to present peptide ligands to CD4 + [ 6 6 4 _ T D $ D I F F ] lymphocytes and these T cells are consequently believed to have a key pathogenic role in MS.

{"text":"A B S T R A C T Our current knowledge of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS) predates improved specificity in the diagnosis of IPS and advances in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and critical care practices. In this study, we describe and update the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of IPS. We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adults who underwent allogeneic HCT at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center between 2006 and 2013 (n = 1829). IPS was defined using the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute consensus definition: multilobar airspace opacities on chest imaging, absence of lower respiratory tract infection, and hypoxemia. We described IPS incidence and mortality within 120 and 365 days after HCT. We examined conditioning intensity (nonmyeloablative versus myeloablative with high-dose total body irradiation [TBI] versus myeloablative with low-dose TBI) as an IPS risk factor in a time-to-event analysis using Cox models, controlled for age at transplant, HLA matching, stem cell source, and pretransplant Lung function Score (a combined measure of impairment in Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV 1 ) and Diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)). Among 1829 HCT recipients, 67 fulfilled IPS criteria within 120 days (3.7%). Individuals who developed IPS were more likely to be black\/non-Hispanic versus other racial groups and have severe pulmonary impairment but were otherwise similar to participants without IPS. In adjusted models, myeloablative conditioning with high-dose TBI was associated with increased risk of IPS (hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 5.2). Thirty-one patients (46.3%) with IPS died within the first 120 days of HCT and 47 patients (70.1%) died within 365 days of HCT. In contrast, among the 1762 patients who did not acquire IPS in the first 120 days, 204 (11.6%) died within 120 days of HCT and 510 (29.9%) died within 365 days of HCT. Our findings suggest that although the incidence of IPS may be declining, it remains associated with post-transplant mortality. Future study should focus on early detection and identifying pathologic mediators of IPS to facilitate timely, targeted therapies for those most susceptible to lung injury post-HCT.","meta":{"paper_id":"109cceb7306b8e73e47f9778cf154a5d1833e6e6","title":"Infectious Disease Incidence, Risk Factors, and Outcomes of Idiopathic Pneumonia Syndrome after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation"}}
{"text":"Background: Immunosuppressive therapy for renal allograft recipients has changed substantially since the introduction of the anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, basiliximab. We hypothesized that recent improvements in immunosuppressive treatment may reduce the incidence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH). This study aimed to investigate transitional changes in the incidence of OFNH among renal transplant recipients by MRI. Methods: Participants comprised 110 patients who had undergone renal transplantation from 2003 to 2012, during which time basiliximab was in regular use at our institute (Recent group), and 232 patients who had undergone RT between 1986 and 2003 (Past group). We compared ONFH incidence between the two groups and evaluated risk factors for ONFH, including immunosuppressants (calcineurin inhibitors, basiliximab, and\/or steroids) and postoperative renal function. Results: Incidence of ONFH was lower in the Recent group (0%) than in the Past group (3.4%; p \u00bc 0.043). In the Recent group, age was greater, ABO\/human leukocyte antigen incompatibility was worse, while steroid dose was decreased and post-transplant renal function was improved. Cumulative methylprednisolone dose at postoperative week 2 and delayed graft function were identified as risk factors for ONFH. Conclusion: Risk of ONFH after renal transplantation has fallen with the advent of regular use of basiliximab, although this agent does not appear to be a factor directly associated with the incidence of ONFH.

{"text":"Objective To characterize the first-wave epidemiologic features of influenza-like illness (ILI) associated with the novel pandemic A \u2044 H1N1 [A(H1N1)pdm09] virus. Methods We used generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) to assess risk factors and non-parametric and \u2044 or parametric distributions to estimate attack rates, secondary attack rates (SAR), duration of illness, and serial interval during a laboratoryconfirmed community outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09 clustered around on-reserve residents and households of an elementary school in rural British Columbia, Canada, in late April \u2044 early May 2009. ILI details were collected as part of outbreak investigation by community telephone survey in early June 2009. Overall, 92 \u2044 408 (23%) of participants developed ILI and 36 \u2044 408 (9%) experienced medically attended ILI (MAILI). The overall SAR in households was 22%: highest among participants 1-4 years of age (yoa) (50%) followed by <1 yoa (38%), 5-8 yoa (20%), 10-19 yoa (13%), 20-49 yoa (20%), and 50-64 yoa (0%). The median serial interval was estimated at 3AE5 days (95% CI: 2AE1-5AE1). In multivariable GLMM analysis, having a chronic condition (OR: 2AE58; 95% CI: 1AE1-6AE04), younger age [1-8 yoa: OR: 4AE63; 95% CI: 2AE25-9AE52; 9-19 yoa: OR: 1AE95; 95% CI: 0AE97-3AE9 (referent: \u202120 yoa)] and receipt of 2008-2009 influenza vaccine (OR: 2AE68; 95% CI: 1AE37-5AE25) were associated with increased risk of ILI. Median duration of illness was 9 days, longer among those with chronic conditions (21 days). Median time to seeking care after developing illness was 4AE5 days. On-reserve participants had higher chronic conditions, household density, ILI, MAILI, and SAR. Conclusions During a community outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09related illness, we identified substantial clinical ILI attack rates exceeding 20% with secondary household attack rates as high as 50% in young children.

COPD contributes to morbidity and mortality and to a signifi cant use of health-care resources and expense on a global scale; this is especially true in developing countries. 2-4 The burden of COPD in China is currently greater than that found in developed countries. This is probably due to greater exposure to epidemic risk factors, an imbalance in economic development, and health-care disparities between urban and rural areas. The reported prevalence of COPD Although, to our knowledge, there has been no exhaustive or credible review of the evidence of the disease burden of COPD in China, COPD has become an increasing public health concern to the Chinese medical community. The purpose of this article is to review the evidence and evaluate and clarify the disease burden of COPD in China with the aim of improving effective management. We reviewed previous studies of COPD in China, which included data on prevalence, mortality, disease burden, risk factors, diagnosis, and management by searching related Web sites, including PubMed, ProQuest, and Thomson Reuters' Web of Knowledge, as well as major Chinese databases and government Web sites. Reported COPD prevalence varied between 5% and 13% in different provinces\/cities across China. In 2008, COPD ranked fourth as a leading cause of death in urban areas and third in rural areas. In addition, COPD accounted for 1.6% of all hospital admissions in China in that year. The high prevalence of smoking and biomass fuel use acted as major contributors to the high occurrence of COPD in China. Management of COPD in China should focus on adjusting the distribution of medical resources and on addressing public health policies to facilitate earlier diagnosis in rural areas, aim to reduce smoking prevalence, improve patients' self-management, and keep physicians' knowledge up to date and consistent with current guidelines. COPD is one of the most challenging medical issues facing China because of its infl uence on both personal and public health and its impact on the economy. Optimal management strategies should be adopted and strengthened immediately.

{"text":"The definition of mitigation includes a wide variety of measures taken before an event occurs that will prevent illness, injury, and death and limit the loss of property. Taking steps to mitigate potential hazards has taken on increasing favor in disaster preparedness circles, particularly in the international arena, where the pursuit of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and disaster risk management (DRM) is emphasized above efforts focused simply on disaster event response. The absolutely stunning loss of life, illnesses, injury, psychological impact, displacement from home and community, and social and financial consequences of a disaster, coupled with its disproportionate impact on the already disadvantaged, makes it imperative to fully implement the best principles and practices of disaster mitigation. 1 These principles and practices fall into two types: 1. Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) aims to reduce the damage caused by natural hazards like earthquakes, floods, droughts, and cyclones, through the ethic of prevention. 2 2. Disaster Risk Management (DRM) includes management activities that address and seek to correct or reduce disaster risks that are already present. 3 The Hyogo Framework for Action 4 offers guiding principles, priorities for action, and practical means to achieve disaster resilience for vulnerable communities. Priorities for action include the following: 1. Ensure that DRR is a national and local priority with a strong institutional basis for implementation 2. Identify, assess, and monitor disaster risks and enhance early warning 3. Use knowledge, innovation, and education to build a culture of safety and resilience at all levels 4. Reduce the underlying risk factors 5. Strengthen disaster preparedness for effective response at all levels Although the primary emphasis on the Hyogo Framework is natural disasters, the processes discussed and framework for community resiliency and partnerships have application to all types of hazard responses. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reinforces the importance of engaging \"not only FEMA and its federal partners, but also local, tribal, state and territorial partners; non-governmental faith-based and nonprofit organizations, and private sector industry; to individuals, families and communities, who continue to be the nation's most important assets as first responders during a disaster.\" Engaging local communities and a diverse set of partners ensures that the \"unique and diverse needs of a population\" are met and helps communities become more resilient after a disaster. 5","meta":{"paper_id":"ce4ea901ded26a6c733f1db945ce34f4aedc63c7","title":"Disaster Mitigation"}}

Several risk factors contribute to the pathogenesis of HCC, such as chronic persistent infection with hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus, chronic untreated inflammation of liver with different etiology, oxidative stress and fatty liver disease. Several treatment protocols are used in the treatment of HCC but they also associated with diverse side effects. Many natural products are helpful in the co-treatment and prevention of HCC. Several mechanisms are involved in the action of these herbal products and their bioactive compounds in the prevention and co-treatment of HCC. They can inhibit the liver cancer development and progression in several ways as protecting against liver carcinogens, enhancing effects of chemotherapeutic drugs, inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis, and suppression of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. In this review, we will discuss the utility of diverse natural products in the prevention and co-treatment of HCC, through its capturing of the common risk factors known to lead to HCC and shed the light on their possible mechanisms of action.

{"text":"Background: Respiratory viral infections are a major cause of hospitalisation in infants <1 year and might cause severe symptoms in preterm infants. Our aim was to analyse admissions due to respiratory infections in moderate, late and term infants, and to identify risk factors for hospitalisation in preterm versus term. Methods: Prospective study in a cohort of moderate and late preterm, and term infants born between October\/2011 and December\/2012. Admissions due to respiratory infections during the first year of life were analysed and compared among moderate (32---33), late (34---36) and term infants. Sixteen respiratory viruses were detected by RT-PCR. Clinical data were collected. Results: 30 (20.9%) out of 143 preterm infants required admission for respiratory infection, versus 129 (6.9%) of 1858 term infants born in the same period (p < 0.0001, OR: 3.6 CI 2.0 to 5.0). Hospitalised children had a higher prevalence of hyaline membrane disease (HMD) at birth (p < 0.001, OR: 7.7 CI: 2.121 to 27.954) and needed more mechanical ventilation (p < 0.001, OR: 5.7 CI: 1.813 to 18.396).

Efficacy of commercial bovine vaccines needs improvement and no human vaccine is licensed yet.

The aim of this work was to evaluate this new vaccine that uses a conserved viral antigen, in calves, natural hosts for BRSV. Calves, free of colostral or natural anti-BRSV antibodies, were vaccinated with N SRS either intramuscularly, or both intramuscularly and intranasally using Montanide TM ISA71 and IMS4132 as adjuvants and challenged with BRSV. All vaccinated calves developed anti-N antibodies in blood and nasal secretions and N-specific cellular immunity in local lymph nodes. Clinical monitoring post-challenge demonstrated moderate respiratory pathology with local lung tissue consolidations for the non-vaccinated calves that were significantly reduced in the vaccinated calves. Vaccinated calves had lower viral loads than the nonvaccinated control calves.

{"text":"Lung transplantation is now considered an established therapeutic option for patients with severe respiratory failure. Nevertheless, complications are frequent and can lead to intermediate-or long-term graft dysfunction and decreased survival. According to the registry of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation, survival rates in these patients at one, two, and five years are 74%, 65%, and 47%, respectively. The main obstacle to long-term success of lung transplantation, however, is chronic rejection, which is characterized histologically as bronchiolitis obliterans and occurs in up to two-thirds of patients. One of the most important risk factors for the development of bronchiolitis obliterans, in addition to the number of previous acute rejection episodes and the incidence of persistent rejection, is cytomegalovirus infection and disease. Moreover, recent evidence has indicated a role for respiratory viruses as risk factors for the development of chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients. Infectious complications are a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients and are the cause of death in nearly half of them. Bacterial infection is the most frequent infectious complication in lung transplant patients. Among the total of infections, 35%-66% are bacterial and 50%-85% of patients present at least one episode. CMV is the second most frequent cause of infectious complications following lung transplantation. Despite the use of various preventive strategies, the risk of developing CMV disease in lung transplant recipients is over 5% during the first year.

{"text":"BACKGROUND: Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the main limitation to long-term survival after lung transplantation. Because effective therapies are lacking, early identification and mitigation of risk factors is a pragmatic approach to improve outcomes. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) is the most pervasive risk factor for CLAD, but diagnosis requires transbronchial biopsy, which carries risks. We hypothesized that gene expression in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell pellet (CP) could replace biopsy and inform on mechanisms of CLAD. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing on BAL CPs from 219 lung transplant recipients with A-grade ACR (n = 61), lymphocytic bronchiolitis (n = 58), infection (n = 41), or no rejection\/infection (n = 59). Differential gene expression was based on absolute fold difference >2.0 and Benjaminiadjusted p-value \u22640.05. We used the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery Bioinformatics Resource for pathway analyses. For classifier modeling, samples were randomly split into training (n = 154) and testing sets (n = 65).

Study design: Analysis of Prospective surveillance data for Beijing collected during the outbreak. Methods: Surveillance data were reclassified according to World Health Organization criteria. Cases previously excluded without date of onset of illness were included in the epidemic curve from estimates using the average time between date of onset and date of hospitalization for cases with both dates. Cases who failed to give a contact history were now included; 7% (n \u00bc 5) of cases during the import phase and 61% (n \u00bc 365) during the peak phase. Previously excluded cases were included for plotting on an epidemic curve, and basic spot mapping for distribution of cases was used from attack rates recalculated for age, gender, occupation, residential location, date of onset of illness and demographics. Results: The spot map effectively illustrated clusters by residency, with the innercity sustaining the highest attack rate (33.42 per 100,000), followed by an easterly distribution 5-30 km away (21.62 per 10,000), and lowest in districts 60-160 km away (9.21 per 100,000). The new epidemic curve shows the outbreak commencing 10 days earlier than initially reported, with a three-fold greater increase in cases during the escalation phase than previously estimated.

{"text":"Background: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent nosocomial infections. Since 1999, a national coordination of regional networks has been implemented to gather SSI incidence data according to standardised method. The aim of the current study was to describe the largest database ever collected in France on SSI and to analyse a 6-year temporal trend. Methods: Surgery patients were enrolled by voluntary participating wards in a yearly 3-month incidence survey. In each ward, 200 consecutive surgery procedures should be included and patients followed up to 30 days after surgery. SSI was defined based on standard CDC criteria. For each patient, risk factors were collected on the day of surgery including age, ASA score, Altemeier wound class, type and duration of procedure, emergency\/elective, and when videoscopy surgery was performed. Results: During 6 years, the study included 620,176 operations (17,430,253 operated patient-days follow-up; median post-operative follow-up: 28 days). The overall SSI incidence rate was 1.68%. Organ space and deep incisional SSI accounted for 41.7% although their proportion varied according to the type of surgery. SSI incidence rate increased from 0.91% [0.88-0.94%] for NNIS-0 patients to 13.8% [12.5\u221215.2%] for NNIS-2, 3 patients. The SSI incidence varied from 1.15% for herniorraphy to 9.2% for colon surgery. In NNIS-0 patients, emergency surgery increased the SSI risk for C-section whereas videoscopy surgery was at lower risk for cholecystectomy. From 1999 to 2004, NNIS-0 SSI incidence decreased from 1.1 to 0.9 for 100 operated patients (relative difference: \u221218%). According to procedure, the trend remained significant only for herniorraphy. Conclusion: This database provided thorough standardised estimate of SSI incidence according to various surgery procedures. Impact of the national policy on SSI incidence remains to be further evaluated, although encouraging results were evidenced for specific surgery. Objectives: Healthcare associated infection (HAI) incidence rates after delivery range from 0.26% to 20.3% according to the mode of delivery, the maternity activity, women risk factors. Data on HAI surveillance in maternity units are lacking. The Mater Sud-Est Study Group is a HAI continuous surveillance network on maternity units located in south eastern France. We report changes in risk-adjusted HAI rates over a 6-year long surveillance period in this maternity units network. Methods: 161,077 vaginal deliveries and 37,074 cesarean deliveries were included in the surveillance between January 1st 1997 and December 31st 2003. We studied the changes in four HAI: endometritis and Urinary tract infection (UTI) after vaginal deliveries, surgical site infection (SSI) and UTI after cesarean deliveries. We used a logistic regression modeling to estimate risk-adjusted HAI rates. The year of delivery was considered as a risk factor. The trend of risk-adjusted HAI rates over the study period was studied by a linear regression of the year-of-delivery odds ratios for each targeted HAI. Results: The rate of endometritis and UTI after vaginal deliveries was 0.3% (534\/161,077) and 0.5% (728\/161,077) respectively. Over the study period the decrease in endometritis odd ratios was statistically significant. We found no statistically significant trend in vaginal delivery's UTI. The rate of SSI and UTI after cesarean deliveries was 1.5% (571\/37,074) and 1.8% (685\/37,074) respectively. Over the study period the decrease in SSI and UTI odd ratios was statistically significant. Conclusion: These findings highlight the positive effect of participating in a surveillance network for infection control and for improvement of care. Infection Alert, Investigation & Surveillance Network (RAISIN) Bordeux, FR Background: National surveillance of occupational blood and body fluids exposures (BBFE) in France is conducted since 2002 through the Nosocomial Infection Early Warning, Investigation and Surveillance Network (Raisin) in collaboration with Geres (Groupe d'Etude sur le Risque d'Exposition des Soignants aux Agents Infectieux). Methods: Participation of healthcare facilities (HCF) is voluntary and anonymous. BBFE occurring from 01\/01\/04 to 31\/12\/04 were documented using a standardised questionnaire documenting the nature, circumstances (mechanism, type of device, infectious status of the source) and follow-up of each BBFE. Incidence of BBFE is reported per 100 hospitalisation beds, by type of personnel per 100 full time equivalents (FTE), or by type of material per 100,000 devices. S4 17th ECCMID \/ 25th ICC, Oral presentations Results: In 2004, 13,041 BBFE were documented in 371 participating HCF, which accounted for 15% of HCF and 29% of hospitalisation beds in France. BBFE overall incidence was 8.9 per 100 beds. Considering that all French hospitals account for 465,494 beds, 41,276 [95% CI: 40,896-41,656] BBFE could have occurred in France in 2004. HCV or HIV status of the source was not known for more than 20% of documented BBFE. Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was prescribed to 4.5% of exposed personnel (vs. 5.8% in 2003 and 6.3% in 2002); this decrease may reflect the impact of April 2003 French recommendations, which reduced PEP indications. For the first time in 2004, sutures were the most frequent cause of BBFE associated with needles (more than subcutaneous injections) and accounted for 1,103 (11%) of all BBFE; one third occurred among residents, and 20% in ICU or emergency rooms (beyond surgery or obstetrics). Prevention through education and use of safety devices (such as blunt suture needles) may thus be a priority. Data from a cohort of 173 HCF which participated in 2003 and 2004 also were compared and demonstrate significant progresses. Compliance to glove use increased from 58.6% in 2003 to 62.3% in 2004, and BBFE incidence among nurse assistants fell from 2.3 in 2003 to 2.1 per 100 FTE in 2004. Last, BBFE incidence fell from 17.2 to 13.7 per 100,000 catheters, and from 71.6 to 43.2 per 100,000 implantable venous access systems. Conclusion: AES-Raisin is one of the biggest BBFE surveillance network and results demonstrate an increase in observance to standard precautions and a significant decrease in the incidence of some types of BBFE. They also point out future priorities for improvement. O18 A randomised trial of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol compared with 10% povidone-iodine for venipuncture site disinfection: effects on blood culture contamination rates G. Suwanpimolkul, M. Pongkumpai, W. Kulwichit, C. Suankratay (Bangkok, TH) Background: Contaminated blood cultures have been recognized as a bothersome issue for decades, and continue to cause a frustration for clinicians. The contamination rates vary widely between institutions from less than 1% to over 6%. Skin antiseptics can prevent the contamination of blood cultures. To our knowledge, no randomised trial of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol for venipuncture site disinfection has been conducted. Objective: Our study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of venipuncture site disinfection with 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol compared with 10% povidone-iodine in preventing blood culture contamination. Patients and Methods: A prospectively randomised investigator-blinded trial was conducted in all patients hospitalised in Internal Medicine wards and attended at emergency department at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand from August 15 to October 31, 2006. Antecubital venipuncture sites were randomly disinfected with either 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol or 10% povidone-iodine, and blood cultures were drawn by medical students or residents. The blood culture contamination rate associated with each antiseptic was then determined. Results: Of 2,146 blood culture collected during the study, 108 (5.03%) were contaminated with skin flora. The contamination rate for blood cultures after 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol was 3.2% (34 of 1,068), compared with a rate of 6.9% (74 of 1,078) (P < 0.001) after 10% povidone-iodine. Of the inpatient wards, the contamination rate was 2.6% (18 of 695) and 3.9% (28 of 709) after 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol and 10% povidone-iodine, respectively (P = 0.013). Of emergency department, the contamination rate was 4.3% (16 of 373) and 12.5% (46 of 369) after 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol and 10% povidone-iodine, respectively (P < 0.001). The most common contaminant organism was coagulase-negative staphylococci (81%). Conclusion: 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol is superior to 10% povidone-iodine for venipuncture site disinfection before blood culture sampling. Objectives: The inanimate hospital environment can become contaminated with nosocomial pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) decontamination has proven effective for the eradication of persistent environmental contamination but the rate of recontamination following HPV decontamination is largely unknown. We investigated the extent of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) and gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative rod (GNR) contamination in a ward side-room occupied by a patient with a history of MRSA, VRE and GNR infection and colonisation. Methods: Fifteen standardised sites in the room were sampled using a selective broth enrichment protocol to culture for MRSA, VRE and GNR. Sampling was carried out before cleaning, after cleaning, after HPV decontamination and at intervals over the subsequent 19 days on two separate occasions. Results: Environmental contamination was identified before cleaning on 60%, 30% and 6.7% of sites for MRSA, GNR and VRE, respectively and 40%, 10% and 6.7% of sites after cleaning (figure). Only one site (3.3%) was contaminated with MRSA after HPV decontamination (figure). No recontamination with VRE was identified and no recontamination with MRSA and GNR was identified in the two days following HPV decontamination (figure). Substantial recontamination towards pre-cleaning levels was identified by day five and six after HPV decontamination for MRSA. Recontamination with GNR at approximately post-cleaning levels was noted on days 7, 8 and 19 ( Figure 1 ). Infection control S5 infection control measures. Detection of risk groups and infection sources and knowing the transmission ways of infections are important for the prevention from NI. In this study it was aimed to evaluate the knowledge level and behaviour models of hospital cleaning staff about NI in our setting which is a 1788 bedded tertiary care educational hospital. Methods: A questionnaire of with 21 questions was implemented to the hospital cleaning staff, who volunteered to enter the study. The questionnaire was composed of two parts: first part contained parameters for determination of sociodemographic properties and the second contained questions about evaluation of the knowledge about prevention from NI. Questions were prepared by using the references about the subject and by the help of the executives of the cleaning staff firm and statistics unit. Data were evaluated by SPSS 13.0 programme using Chi square and Student's t tests. The questionnaire was completed by one by one interview method. Results: A total of 240 of 290 (82.7% of total, 122 male, 118 female, aged 36.2\u00b18.7) hospital cleaning staff volunteered to enter the study. When evaluated according to the educational status; 55.4% were graduated from primary school and only 54% had been working in the hospital more than three years. Mean knowledge level was 18.15\u00b13.97 (maximum 24). Knowledge level was not associated with gender, educational status and duration of working as cleaning staff (p > 0.05) but mean knowledge level of the staff working in the clinics was found higher than staff working in administrative sections (p < 0.05). 71.3% had received a formal education about prevention from NI before starting working but their mean knowledge level was not different from the others (p = 0.294). Only 48% and 50% knew the true order (x,y), while cleaning the patient rooms. 58.8% thought that they could prevent themselves from NI by hand washing before and after cleaning process, 80.8% stated they obeyed handwashing rules and 90.4% stated that they used gloves. Only 48.3% stated that they dried their hands by paper towels. Conclusion: Measurement of the level of the knowledge of the hospital cleaning staff may be beneficial for determination of the existing problems. Periodical well-established educational programmes should be started to improve the current situation. Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes increasing healthcare problems worldwide. Rapid and sensitive screening methods for direct detection of MRSA are essential to limit further spread in the hospital. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the new molecular dipstick assay GenoQuick \u00ae MRSA (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) for the direct and specific detection of MRSA in clinical specimens. Methods: The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated by using a subset of 25 MRSA isolates (including SCCmec types I\u2212V); 17 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 38 coagulase-negative staphylocococi (CoNS) of different culture collections. The lower detection limit of the assay was determined by serial dilutions of MRSA strains representing SCCmec types I to IV. The test was evaluated for direct detection of MRSA in clinical swab specimens. MRSA carriage was analysed by both the standard culture methods [Chromagar MRSA (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), Columbia blood agar, trypticase soy broth] and two PCR assays [GenoQuick MRSA and GenoType \u00ae MRSA Direct (Hain Lifescience)]. Both PCR assays were performed directly from the swab and after overnight incubation in trypticase soy broth. MRSA isolates were confirmed using a mecA gene and S. aureus specific PCR. Susceptibility testing was performed with an automated system (VITEK 2, bioM\u00e9rieux, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany). Results: The lower detection limit of 25 CFU was determined with serially diluted MRSA strains. For analytical specificity all MRSA strains representing SCCmec types I to V were tested positive by the assay. The MSSA and CoNS were tested negative, respectively. Of 187 patient specimens tested for clinical evaluation, 24 were identified MRSA-positive by culture and by both PCR assays. One specimen was positive only by PCR. Among the 163 culture-negative specimens, 162 were negative with both PCR assays. The GenoQuick assay showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 100%, and a diagnostic specificity of 99.4%, a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative predictive value of 100%. Time-to-result for the direct detection of MRSA from clinial specimens is reduced to 2h 20min with the molecular GenoQuick MRSA dipstick assay (2h 5min for amplification and 15 min for detection). Conclusions: The GenoQuick MRSA dip stick assay proved to be a rapid, sensitive and specific assay for direct detection of MRSA in clinical swab specimens in 2h 20min. O22 Throat swabs are necessary to reliably detect carriers of Staphylococcus aureus Background: The anterior nares are considered to be the primary colonisation site of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and approximately 30% of healthy people carry the bacteria in their anterior nares. However, recent studies indicate that the throat may be an additional important site of colonisation (Nilsson P. J Clin Microbiol 2006). Most screening programmes for S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) require a swab from the nose only, and a swab of the throat is not considered as standard. Objectives: To determine the frequency of positive S. aureus cultures with positive samples from the throat and negative from the nares. Methods: Specimens were obtained with a sterile polyester fiber-tipped swab moistened with sterile saline from the anterior nares (5 rotations in each anterior nostril), the posterior wall of the pharynx, and the soft palate. Swabs were transported to the laboratory in a transport tube (M40 Transystem, Copan, Brescia, Italy) and put in selective enrichment broth (Chapman broth containing brain heart infusion broth with 6% NaCl, Biomedics, Madrid, Spain). Results: A total of 905 individuals were screened for S. aureus between 2000 and 2005. Complete data were unavailable from 54 individuals who were excluded. Overall, S. aureus was isolated in 386\/851 (45.4%) individuals from any site. Screening results No. of % of overall Nares Throat individuals positive pos pos 196 50.8% pos neg 119 30.8% neg pos 71 18.4% 386 100% neg neg 465 Conclusion: Limiting S. aureus screening to the nares fails to identify 18.4% of carriers. Additional cost can be avoided by pooling the specimens while maintaining the higher sensitivity. Therefore, optimal screening for S. aureus should include swabs from both the nares and the throat. This may be even more important if screening is focused on MRSA carriage. Objectives: MRSA rates in a hospital in the North-East of Scotland were significantly declining due to a series of infection control interventions. S6 17th ECCMID \/ 25th ICC, Oral presentations These included terminal disinfection of the environment in isolation rooms and cohort areas by application of 1:1000 sodium hypochlorite in place of detergent (ECCMID '06, abstract P1333). We evaluated the effect of replacing sodium hypochlorite with a standard detergent. Methods: From January 1997 to May 2006, monthly percentage, nonduplicate S. aureus clinical cases caused by MRSA were collated. In February 2005 hypochlorite cleaning solution as replaced by a standard detergent. Other infection control measures remained unchanged. Dynamic regression analysis with linear transfer functions and interrupted time-series analyses were used to estimate the effect to the intervention. Results: Previously, MRSA rates wee successfully reduced due to environmental screening (p = 0.03), use of hypochlorite for environmental disinfection (p = 0.002), use of alcohol based hand disinfection (p = 0.03) and patient admission screening (p < 0.01). Stopping the hypochlorite disinfection was associated with a sudden increase in clinical cases of MRSA from 10 to 25% over a 6 month period (p = 0.03), with levels approaching those seen prior to the start of the infection control programme in 2001 (see figure). Conclusions: Stopping hypochlorite environmental disinfection was strongly associated with an increase in clinical MRSA cases. This work adds significantly to the meagre published evidence that environmental contamination is important in the spread of MRSA. Objectives: To determine antibiotic-resistant enterococci in Portuguese piggery samples and to analyse antibiotic resistance genes among these strains after European growth promoter ban. Methods: Samples from waste treatment and dry faeces from 2 pig farms in the South of Portugal were studied during 2006. Samples were plated onto selective Slanetz-Bartley agar with or without antibiotics. Bacterial identification was performed by both standard biochemical profiles and amplification of species specific genes. Antibiotic susceptibility (12 antibiotics) was determined by disk diffusion method (CLSI). Detection of genes coding for resistance [vanA, B, C1, C2, ermA, B, C, tetM, L, O, K, S, aac(6 )-Ie-aph(2 )-Ia, aph(2 )-Ib,Ic,Id, aph(3 )-IIIa, vat E] were searched by PCR. Results: We identified 84 enterococci (9 E. faecalis, 17 E. faecium, 1 E. gallinarum, 2 E. casseliflavus and 55 Enterococcus spp.) . Most isolates showed decreased susceptibility to tetracycline, minocycline, erythromycin, and quinupristin-dalfopristin (95%, 94%, 80%, 54%, respectively), and to a lesser extent to high-level of resistance (HLR) of streptomycin, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, HLR to gentamicin, chloramphenicol and ampicillin (52%, 33%, 32%, 21%, 11%, 10%). All were susceptible to glycopeptides. Non-susceptible isolates to tetracyclines, aminoglycosides and macrolides contained tetM (55%), tetL (54%), tetM+tetL (32%), tetS (5%), aac(6 )-Ie-aph(2 )-Ia (89%), aac(6 )-Ie-aph(2 )-Ia+aph(3 )-IIIa (47%), ermB (49%). vanC1 was linked to E. gallinarum, and vanC2 to E. casseliflavus as expected. Conclusions: Although all growth promoters were progressively removed from EU in the course of the last 10 years, antibiotic multiresistant enterococci were isolated in Portuguese piggeries. Whether persistence of these antibiotic resistant strains is due to selection by antibiotics or other agents deserves further studies. O25 Experiences and results from the surveillance programme of resistance in feed, food and animals in Norway (NORM-VET) 2000-2005 M. Norstr\u00f6m, H. Tharaldsen, M. Sunde (Oslo, NO) Objectives: The monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in the veterinary and food production sectors (NORM-VET) was established in 2000. The goals of the programme are to monitor the antimicrobial resistance situation in feed, food and animals over time, in relation to the human situation and to the resistance situation in other countries. Data from NORM-VET could form a basis for risk assessments and be a tool for targeting interventions and further to evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions. This study was performed to summarise the experiences and results obtained during the first six years of the programme. Methods: The zoonotic agents Salmonella (from feed, animals and food) and Campylobacter jejuni (from broiler and broiler meat) were monitored annually. E. coli and Enterococcus spp. (indicator bacteria) were sampled from various animal species and meat products biannually. Specific clinical isolates from the routine diagnostic have been included biannually. The isolates have mainly been tested using a microdilution technique (VetMICTM). The minimum inhibitory concentrations were recorded and analysed in WHONET 5.3. For the categorising of the isolates as resistant or susceptible epidemiological cut-off values were applied. The occurrence of resistance in the monitored species and products is in an international perspective low and the results from the first six years of the programme show that the situation is stable. Conclusion: Evaluation of the first six years of the programme has recognized that the relatively low number of isolates of each species and source included complicates the conclusions possible to draw from the data, especially evaluating trends over time. Even though the run costs of the programme has been limited to a minimum, it is still useful for the purpose of monitoring antimicrobial resistance within a country as Norway, where the resistance problem in the animal and food sectors still is at a very low level. It also consists as valuable source for further research of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and development. However, the use of this source to perform risk assessments is limited as there still is a lack of even more specific data as for instance data on usage at animal or farm level. O26 Comparison of antibiotic susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus and S. intermedius isolates from dog owners and their dogs Objectives: Antibiotic resistance in veterinary isolates has been reported to be higher than in human isolates due to frequent empirical use, and there are concerns about transfer of resistance between staphylococcal species. S. intermedius is the more common colonising species in dogs, but S. aureus, including MRSA, may also be present. Case reports suggest there can be cross-infection between companion animals and man. Increasing concern about MRSA in the community has led to recommendations for surveillance of antibiotic resistance in isolates from companion animals. This study compared antibiotic resistance in isolates of S. aureus and S. intermedius from dogs and their owners. Methods: A cross-sectional study of owners and their dogs was performed using a convenience sample of 800 pairs recruited at six veterinary practices. Nasal swabs were collected from both owner and Resistance surveillance S7 dog, and held at 4\u00baC in transport medium until culture within 8 h of collection. Subjects completed a questionnaire providing demographic information of owner and dog, and stating if the dog had received antibiotics within the last 3 months. Swabs were inoculated onto blood agar and mannitol salt agar and placed in 5% salt meat broth for enrichment. S. aureus or S. intermedius were identified by means of coagulase, VP, polymyxin susceptibility, and trehalose fermentation. Several colonies of each isolate were tested for susceptibility to methicillin. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by disc diffusion and interpreted using CLSI guidelines. Results: S. aureus: 168 owners (25%) and 64 dogs (8.5%) were colonised. 16 owners and their dogs were concurrently colonised. 6 dogs (1.3%) and 4 humans (0.5%) were colonised with MRSA. Resistance to oxacillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and fusidic acid was significantly higher in dog isolates. S. intermedius: 64 dogs (7.9%) and 8 owners (1.1%) carried S. intermedius. Four colonised owners had colonised dogs. Methicillin resistance was not detected. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole was higher in dog isolates. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and gentamicin was only displayed by dog isolates. Conclusions: Methicillin resistance was found only in S. aureus, but resistance to other antibiotics was higher in S. intermedius. Dog isolates were more resistant than human for both species. Veterinary use of antibiotics may increase resistance and the risk of transmission of resistant strains. Objectives: Antimicrobial susceptibility to human-use antibiotics was investigated among the commensal bacteria E. coli (Ec) and Enterococcus spp. (Ent) from healthy food animals at slaughter across the EU. Methods: Colon or caecal content was randomly collected at 4 abattoirs per country (n = 5 per host). Each herd\/flock was sampled once. Ec and Ent were isolated using standard methods. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by agar dilution (CLSI, M31-A2) against 9 (Ec) and 5 (Ent) antibiotics in a central laboratory. Resistance (CLSI, M100-S16) was assessed per drug\/organism\/country. Results: A total 1465 Ec were recovered (cattle n = 490, pigs n = 494, chickens n = 481). Mean resistance (%) for Ec was: ampicillin (A) 3, 29, 53; cefepime 0, 0, 0; cefotaxime 0, 0, 0.4; ciprofloxacin 1, 0.4, 6; chloramphenicol 2, 16, 15; colistin 0, 0.4, 0; gentamicin (G) 1, 2, 2; tetracycline 8, 66, 65; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 4, 42, 52 respectively. For Ec, Italy and Spain consistently showed the highest resistance; Denmark showed the lowest. A total of 718 Ent isolates were recovered, comprising 356 E. faecium, 83 E. faecalis and 279 other species including E. durans, E. hirae and E. casseliflavus. All Ent but one bovine isolate, were susceptible to linezolid. For E. faecium resistance to A and G was 0\u22122%; vancomycin (V) resistance amounted to 1.9 to 3.5%, whereas resistance to quinupristin\/dalfopristin (Q\/D) combination varied: 8% (cattle), 19% (pigs) and 20% (chickens). Though low prevalence of E. faecalis limited conclusions, particularly in chickens (n = 6), G and V resistance was low in cattle and pigs (0-11%), resistance to Q\/D was very high (46 and 83%, respectively). In the other Ent species, resistance among the 3 hosts to G and V was low (0\u22121.6%). Resistance to A was absent except in chickens: 9.8%. Q\/D resistance was among the highest: 5\u22129% for livestock hosts; 26% in poultry. Striking differences among countries were absent for Ent. Conclusion: This pan-EU survey, with uniform methodology, shows that antimicrobial resistance among enteric commensal bacteria at slaughter was variable. For Ec, prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied for older antimicrobials and between countries but resistance to newer medically important antimicrobials was absent or very low. With respect to Ent, antimicrobial resistance rates varied for quinupristin\/dalfopristin, but resistance was absent or very low for other antimicrobials including linezolid and vancomycin. O28 Demography and antibacterial susceptibility of communityacquired respiratory tract infection pathogens in Year 6 vs Year 5 of the PROTEKT surveillance programme D.J. Farrell, C. Couturier, D. Felmingham (London, UK; Paris, FR) Objectives: Patterns of antibacterial resistance among communityacquired respiratory tract infection (CARTI) pathogens vary among countries. PROTEKT is a global surveillance study monitoring antibacterial resistance among CARTI pathogens. We report here the results of the sixth year of the PROTEKT study (Y6: 2004-2005) and changes compared to Y5 (2003-2004). Methods: Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) and Haemophilus influenzae (HI) from respiratory samples were submitted from 93 centres from 28 countries. MICs and susceptibilities were determined according to CLSI guidelines. Genotyping was performed to define macrolide resistance mechanisms. Frequencies were compared for Y5-Y6 common sites using c 2 or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate with a = 0.05. Results: In Y6, a total of 5182 SPN and 1609 HI were collected. SPN\/HI distribution by site were: sputum & BAL (55%\/72%), blood (19%\/2%), nasopharynx (10%\/13%), ear (10%\/7%), sinus (6%\/6%). The distribution of specimens by age groups were: 2 y 12%, 3\u221214 y 14%, 15\u221264 y 44%, and >64 y 30%. SPN penicillin and erythromycin resistance (PR and ER) prevalences were 19% and 35% respectively [20% erm(B), 9% mef(A), 5% erm(B)+mef(A), and 1% ribosomal mutation]. SPN with both PR and ER was >25% in Far East, South Africa and France and >15% in Hungary, Poland, US and Australia. Significant increases in PR were seen in Poland and China. Falls in PR were seen in Italy, Spain and Japan. Erythromycin resistance was stable in all countries except Germany and Venezuela (decrease). SPN with multiple drug resistance (>2 antibiotic classes) increased in Poland and decreased in Russia. Prevalence of isolates resistant to at least 5 antibiotic classes increased in China. Betalactamase (BL) production in HI was 14% overall, while 2.9% of HI were BL negative and ampicillin resistant (BLNAR). BL production frequencies were stable in all countries except South Africa (increase). Telithromycin showed a sustained activity against both SPN (99.6% susceptible, MIC50\/90 0.015\/0.25 mg\/L) and HI (99.3% susceptible, MIC50\/90 1\/2 mg\/L). Conclusions: Resistance to several first-line antibacterials is a continuing problem worldwide. The last 2 years of PROTEKT indicate changing patterns of resistance in several countries. Telithromycin exhibited significant in vitro activity against the principal CARTI pathogens, including strains resistant to other agents. O29 Community-acquired respiratory tract infections in Europe caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis: report from 10 years of monitoring by the SENTRY Program R. Jones, M. Stilwell, T. Fritsche, H. Sader (North Liberty, US) Objectives: To determine the antimicrobial susceptibility (S) patterns for S. pneumoniae (SPN), H. influenzae (HI) and M. catarrhalis (MCAT) when tested by reference CLSI methods using samples collected from 1997-2006 in 13 European (EUR) nations. Trends in S and the occurrences of well defined resistance (R) mechanisms were assessed. Methods: A collection of community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CA-RTI) pathogens (6,753 SPN; 6,280 HI; and 1,908 MCAT for all years) were annually forwarded to a central reference laboratory for S test processing and confirmation of organism identity. All antimicrobials were tested by CLSI methods, results interpreted by M100-S16 (2006) and quality control rigidly applied to assure accuracy. Analysis of trends used mean S rates by nation for the initial and last 3 years sampled.","meta":{"paper_id":"3c1f47a07aaf0e393dee9fbd08596a4b9f4f0a03","title":"Infection control O14 Surgical site infection surveillance in France: the first 1999-2004 trend analysis O21 Evaluation of a rapid molecular dipstick assay for the direct detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in clinical specimens O23 Impact of hypochlorite disinfection on MRSA rates Resistance surveillance O24 Multi-drug resistant enterococci among Portuguese swine after growth promoter ban O27 European Antimicrobial Susceptibility Surveillance in Animals (EASSA): Results (2002\/2003) for enteric bacteria from healthy cattle, pigs and chickens from 8 countries"}}
{"text":"Sixty-eight case herds seropositive to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) were compared to 128 seronegative controls in a double-blinded questionnaire survey. The study indicated no increased risk of PRRS seropositivity for herds using artificial insemination with semen from PRRS seropositive AI-stations. Also the herd-size was non-related to the risk of PRRS seropositivity, indicating that air-borne spread of PRRS may not have been a predominant feature in Denmark. Introduction of replacement breeding animals from seropositive breeding-and multiplying herds significantly increased the risk of a herd being PRRS seropositive, as did introduction of 25 kg pigs for feeding. PRRS seropositivity was in the farmers' opinions associated with abortions in sows, early farrowing, high postweaning mortality and low weight gain in fattening pigs. However, the reported frequencies of problems were relatively low. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","meta":{"paper_id":"13401b5c313535668583accd7dccaae14a3fea36","title":"A case-control questionnaire survey of risk factors for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) seropositivity in Danish swine herds"}}
{"text":"Background: Influenza sentinel surveillance in Cote d'Ivoire showed that 70% of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) cases remained without etiology. This work aims to describe the epidemiological, clinical, and virological pattern of ARI that tested negative for influenza virus, in children under five years old. Materials and Methods: one thousand and fifty nine samples of patients presenting influenza Like Illness (ILI) or Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARI) symptoms were tested for other respiratory viruses using multiplex RT-PCR assays targeting 10 respiratory viruses. Results: The following pathogens were detected as follows, hRV 31,92% (98\/307), hRSV 24.4% (75\/329), PIV 20.5% (63\/307), HCoV 229E 12,05% (37\/307), hMPV 6.2% (19\/307), HCoVOC43 1.0% (3\/307) and EnV 1.0% (3\/307). Among the 1,059 specimens analyzed, 917 (86.6%) were ILI samples and 142 (23.4%) were SARI samples. The proportion of children infected with at least one virus was 29.8% (273\/917) in ILI cases and 23.9% (34\/142) in SARI cases. The most prevalent viruses, responsible for ILI cases were hRV with 35.89% (98\/273) and hRSV in SARI cases with 41.2% (14\/34) of cases. Among the 1,059 patients, only 22 (2.1%) children presented risk factors related to the severity of influenza virus infection. Conclusion: This study showed that respiratory viruses play an important role in the etiology of ARI in children. For a better understanding of the epidemiology of ARI and improved case management, it would be interesting in this context to expand the surveillance of influenza to other respiratory viruses.","meta":{"paper_id":"55e21f37b34b47c33bdbec518825f78587906ddd","title":"DETECTION OF NON-INFLUENZA VIRUSES IN ACUTE RESPIRATORY INFECTIONS IN CHILDREN UNDER FIVE-YEAR-OLD IN COTE D'IVOIRE (JANUARY -DECEMBER 2013)"}}
{"text":"Evolving land use practices have led to an increase in interactions at the human\/wildlife interface. The presence and poor knowledge of zoonotic pathogens in India's wildlife and the occurrence of enormous human populations interfacing with, and critically linked to, forest ecosystems warrant attention. Factors such as diverse migratory bird populations, climate change, expanding human population and shrinking wildlife habitats play a significant role in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens from India's wildlife. The introduction of a novel Kyasanur forest disease virus (family flaviviridae) into human populations in 1957 and subsequent occurrence of seasonal outbreaks illustrate the key role that India's wild animals play in the emergence and reemergence of zoonotic pathogens. Other high priority zoonotic diseases of wildlife origin which could affect both livestock and humans include influenza, Nipah, Japanese encephalitis, rabies, plague, leptospirosis, anthrax and leishmaniasis. Continuous monitoring of India's extensively diverse and dispersed wildlife is challenging, but their use as indicators should facilitate efficient and rapid disease-outbreak response across the region and occasionally the globe. Defining and prioritizing research on zoonotic pathogens in wildlife are essential, particularly in a multidisciplinary one-world one-health approach which includes human and veterinary medical studies at the wildlife-livestock-human interfaces. This review indicates that wild animals play an important role in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens and provides brief summaries of the zoonotic diseases that have occurred in wild animals in India.","meta":{"paper_id":"30e6d0f1373227cc590813ddde1cb3f96fd791c8","title":"Role of India's wildlife in the emergence and re-emergence of zoonotic pathogens, risk factors and public health implications"}}

{"text":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis and viral pneumonia in infants and young children worldwide. In the Middle East and Arab countries, the burden of RSV-associated hospitalizations is not well characterized. We sought to determine the burden and clinical\/epidemiological characteristics of RSV hospitalization in young children in Amman, Jordan. We investigated risk factors for severity including vitamin D levels. Methods: We conducted viral surveillance with clinical and demographic data in children <2 years admitted with respiratory symptoms and\/or fever at the Al-Bashir Government Hospital from March16, 2010 to March 31, 2013. Nasal\/throat swabs were obtained and placed into lysis buffer, and frozen at \u221280 \u2022 C until testing by real-time RT-PCR for 11 respiratory viruses. Heel stick blood or sera samples for 25hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels were obtained and sent to a central laboratory for mass spectrometry. Results: Of the 3168 children, >80% testing positive for one virus, with RSV the most common virus detected (44%). The RSV-associated hospitalization rate was highest in children <6 months with an annual range of 21.1-25.9 per 1000, compared to 6.0-8.0 in 6-11-month-olds and 1.6-2.5 in 12-23-month-olds. RSV-positive children compared with RSV-negative were more likely to be previously healthy without underlying medical conditions, less likely to be born prematurely, had a higher frequency of supplemental oxygen use, and had lower median vitamin D levels. Risk factors for oxygen use in RSV-positive children included underlying medical conditions, lack of breastfeeding, younger age, and higher viral load. Conclusion: RSV is a major cause of illness in hospitalized Jordanian children and is associated with increased severity compared to other respiratory viruses. Children with RSV in the Middle East would benefit from future RSV vaccines and antiviral therapy.","meta":{"paper_id":"140c32554663e4033d23a392bd287b0239bfe1d1","title":"Natural history and epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus infection in the Middle East: Hospital surveillance for children under age two in Jordan"}}

{"text":"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is a disease of domestic swine characterized by exceptionally high clinical variability. This study addresses the question of whether clinical variability in PRRS results from (a) genetic variation among viral isolates and\/or (b) variation in management practices among farms on which isolates are found. Genetic data (open reading frame 5 gene sequences) and data on farm characteristics and associated clinical disease signs were collected for 62 PRRS virus (PRRSV) field isolates, representing 52 farms. Clinical disease signs were interrelated \u00d0 confirming that a true reproductive syndrome exists (involving abortions, infertility in sows, deaths of sows and preweaning mortality). Pairs of farms experiencing deaths in their sow populations also tended to share viral isolates which were more similar to one another than expected by chance alone. This implies that sow death (one of the more-severe manifestations of PRRS) is under genetic influence. Large herd size was a significant risk factor for the death of sows and for respiratory disease in nursery pigs. All-in\u00b1allout management practices in the nursery were protective against reproductive signs in the sow herd. All-in\u00b1all-out management practices in the finishing stages of production were protective against respiratory disease in nursery pigs \u00d0 but were paradoxically associated with an increased risk of infertility in sows. These results suggest that farm-management practices can also influence which PRRS clinical signs are manifested during an outbreak. In general, signs associated with PRRS appear to result from a combination of genetic factors and herd-management characteristics. The relative contributions of these two influences differ depending on the specific clinical sign in question. # : S 0 1 6 7 -5 8 7 7 ( 9 9 ) 0 0 1 0 4 -X","meta":{"paper_id":"7f78a49e121f4051e7752d2ddcd77be79d157630","title":"Associations between genetics, farm characteristics and clinical disease in field outbreaks of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus"}}
{"text":"Background: Strategies are urgently needed to mitigate the risk of zoonotic disease emergence in southern China, where pathogens with zoonotic potential are known to circulate in wild animal populations. However, the risk factors leading to emergence are poorly understood, which presents a challenge in developing appropriate mitigation strategies for local communities. Methods: Residents in rural communities of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces were recruited and enrolled in this study. Data were collected through ethnographic interviews and field observations, and thematically coded and analysed to identify both risk and protective factors for zoonotic disease emergence at the individual, community and policy levels. Results: Eighty-eight ethnographic interviews and 55 field observations were conducted at nine selected sites. Frequent human-animal interactions and low levels of environmental biosecurity in local communities were identified as risks for zoonotic disease emergence. Policies and programmes existing in the communities provide opportunities for zoonotic risk mitigation. This study explored the relationship among zoonotic risk and human behaviour, environment and policies in rural communities in southern China. It identifies key behavioural risk factors that can be targeted for development of tailored risk-mitigation strategies to reduce the threat of novel zoonoses.","meta":{"paper_id":"4b36607cdbc54f8006161a9a1839489dd0a51269","title":"A qualitative study of zoonotic risk factors among rural communities in southern China"}}

Design Prospective cohort study. setting A government hospital serving low-income and middle-income population in Amman, Jordan. Participants Children under 2 years of age hospitalised with fever and\/or respiratory symptoms (n=3168) from 16 March 2010 to 31 March 2013. Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study. Outcome measures Hospitalisation rates and markers of illness severity: admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen therapy, length of stay (LOS) and death. results Of the 3168 subjects, 2581 (82%) had at least one respiratory virus detected, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most predominant pathogen isolated. During admission, 1013 (32%) received oxygen therapy, 284 (9%) were admitted to ICU, 111 (4%) were placed on MV and 31 (1%) children died. Oxygen therapy was higher in RSV-only subjects compared with human rhinovirus-only (42%vs29%, p<0.001), adenovirus-only (42%vs21%, p<0.001) and human parainfluenza virusonly (42%vs23%, p<0.001) subjects. The presence of an underlying medical condition was associated with oxygen therapy (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.95, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.56), ICU admission (aOR 2.51, 95% CI 1.71 to 3.68), MV (aOR 1.91, 95% CI 1.11 to 3.28) and longer LOS (aOR1.71, 95% CI 1.37 to 2.13). Similarly, younger age was associated with oxygen therapy (0.23, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.31), ICU admission (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.74), MV (0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.53) and longer LOS (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.59). Pneumonia was strongly associated with longer LOS (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.65 to 2.60), oxygen therapy (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.22 to 3.89), ICU admission (aOR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16 to 4.50) and MV (aOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.85 to 6.00).

Objectives: Evaluate the prevalence of fungi in the respiratory samples of horses diagnosed with IAD, describe clinical signs associated with the presence of fungi in respiratory samples, and assess the risk factors associated with IAD and with the presence of fungi in the airways. Animals: Seven-hundred thirty-one active horses referred to a specialized ambulatory practice for signs of respiratory disease or poor performance. Methods: A prospective observational study was performed, collecting clinical data, environmental conditions, and results of a tracheal wash (TW; cytology, fungal culture, and bacterial culture), and bronchoalveolar lavage (cytology). Results: A positive fungal culture was obtained in 55% (402\/731) of horses.

However, evidence regarding risk of asymptomatic prevalence of ON among different diseases and the impact of variable steroid regimens are conflicting. We aimed to determine the prevalence of ON of femoral head in asymptomatic patients with systemic rheumatic diseases who received high-dose CS and also clarify its relationship with different dosages and regimens. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 50 consecutive patients receiving high-dose CS for rheumatic diseases who have no pelvic pain were recruited. MRI of both hips was performed on all patients using a 1.5 Tesla to diagnose ON. Results: Of 50 subjects, 18 (36%) developed ON of the femoral head. Groups with and without ON were comparable in terms of sex, age and mean starting CS dose. There was no statistical difference in the type of CS regimen including daily dose, peak dose and cumulative dose between the two groups. However, silent ON was associated with both the cumulative CS dose and the duration of CS therapy.

{"text":"Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs. Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process. Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence.","meta":{"paper_id":"ee254e8dd94c816c9b5cd80c56b4b7e07eb5aa03","title":"Global patterns in coronavirus diversity"}}

AD genes are enriched in GWAS datasets reflecting pathogen diversity, suggesting selection for pathogen resistance, as supported by the old age of AD patients, implying resistance to earlier infections. APOE4 is concentrated in regions of high parasitic burden and protects against childhood tropical infections and hepatitis C. Immune\/inflammatory gain of function applies to APOE4, CR1, and TREM2 variants.

Methods: In this multicenter nationwide study a total of 971 HCT procedures (741 allo-HCT; 230 auto-HCT) over a period of 6 years were analyzed. Results: During this period 801 episodes of viral infections were diagnosed in 442 patients. The incidence of viral infections was 57.9% in allo-HCT and 4.8% in auto-HCT patients. The most frequent infections after allo-HCT were caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyoma BK virus (BKV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The majority of infections occurred within the first 4 months after allo-HCT and over 80% required pharmacotherapy or symptomatic therapy. The median time of treatment of specific viral infection ranged from 7 (for EBV) to 24 (for CMV) days. The highest mortality was observed in case of CMV infection. The risk factors for viral infections were allo-HCT, acute leukemia, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (a\/cGVHD), and matched unrelated donor (MUD)\/mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD)-HCT.

We will focus on the potential roles of camel markets, camel shows, importation, transportation and grazing in the amplification and shedding of the virus, providing some novel concepts for the control approaches for the MERS-CoV.","meta":{"paper_id":"78dbccb9c48475f599da9922e4ba3f039a224997","title":"Some One Health based control strategies for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus"}}
{"text":"Beginning in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus spread across Southeast Asia, causing unprecedented epidemics. Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the ''second wave'' of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of freegrazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1. To limit the spread of future outbreaks, efforts to control the movement of poultry products must be sustained. avian influenza \/ epidemiology \/ poultry farming \/ spatial analysis \/ Thailand","meta":{"paper_id":"67db14be4e5b68f4d42496330429a1d86266a161","title":"Anthropogenic factors and the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1: prospects from a spatial-based model"}}

\u202b\u0628\u0642\u0627\u0621\u202c Objectives: To estimate the survival of adult and pediatric patients receiving mechanical ventilation and determine the associated risk factors Methods: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in the intensive care unit (ICU) at King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC) and King Abdullah Children's Specialist Hospital (KACSH), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The analysis includes data from medical records of all patients admitted to ICUs who received mechanical ventilation between 2016-2018. For each patient, potential risk factors were collected. The main outcome of this study was the mortality during the stay in ICU after receiving mechanical ventilation Results: A total of 262 adults and 175 pediatric patients were admitted to ICUs and received mechanical ventilation during the study period. For adult patients, the overall mortality was 37%, with a median survival time of 11 days (interquartile range [IQR] 6-20 days). The main risk factors independently associated with the increased mortality rate were being aged 51-60 (odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.7-1.0) and factors related to ICU admission. For the pediatric population, the mortality rate was 17%, with a median survival time of 16 days (IQR 7-37 days) . Prematurity with respiratory problems was the main recorded cause of initiation of mechanical ventilation (50% of patients). Neonates who had mechanical ventilation within one month of their birth and were born extremely preterm had a high mortality rate after the initiation of mechanical ventilation. Both patient age and the causes of the initiation of mechanical ventilation were influencing the survival of patients who required mechanical ventilation.","meta":{"paper_id":"aa8a0b3cfa95daea83c1fc448904d6627593bb59","title":"From the Department of Respiratory Therapy (Ismaeil, Almutairi, Alshaikh, Althobaiti, Ismaiel), from the Research Unit (Othman), College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Heath Sciences, and King Abdullah International"}}
{"text":"Rationale: Pneumocystis jirovecii causes severe pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Human immunodeficiency virus infection, malignancy, solid organ or hematopoietic cell transplantation, and primary immune deficiency compose the risk factors for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in children, and PCP can be an initial clinical manifestation of primary immune deficiency. Patient concerns: A 5-month-old infant presented with cyanosis and tachypnea. He had no previous medical or birth history suggesting primary immune deficiency. He was diagnosed with interstitial pneumonia on admission. Diagnoses: He was diagnosed with PCP, and further evaluations revealed underlying X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome. Interventions: He was treated with trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole for PCP, and eventually received allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation for hyper-IgM syndrome. Outcomes: Twenty months have passed after transplantation without severe complications. Lessons: PCP should be considered in infants presenting with severe interstitial pneumonia even in the absence of evidence of immune deficiency. Primary immune deficiency should also be suspected in infants diagnosed with PCP.

{"text":"Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC) is associated with multiple factors. The possible transmission source can be via community-acquired infection (CAI) or hospital-associated infection (HAI), but the variable factors within these two routes are not well described. This study aimed to (i) investigate a crosssectional incidence of canine respiratory viruses, including influenza (CIV), parainfluenza, distemper (CDV), respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), adenovirus-2, and herpesvirus, in respiratory-diseased dogs, and (ii) analyze the possibly related risk factors. In total 209 dogs with respiratory illness, consisting of 133 CAI and 76 HAI dogs, were studied. Both nasal and oropharyngeal swabs were sampled from each dog and subjected for CIRDC virus detection using multiplex PCRs. Common six viruses associated with CIRDC were detected in both groups with CIV and CRCoV being predominantly found. Only CDV was significantly more prevalent in CAI than HAI dogs. Multiple virus detections were found in 81.2% and 78.9% of CAI and HAI dogs, respectively. Co-detection of CIV and CRCoV was represented the highest proportion and most often found with other CIRD viruses. Moreover, the clinical severity level was notably related to the age of infected dogs, but not to the vaccination status, sex and transmission route. Since healthy or control dogs were not included in this study, the prevalence of the CIRD virus infections could not be assessed.","meta":{"paper_id":"c64f469a3115f900053a2313679efdf81cb35741","title":"Cross-sectional investigation and risk factor analysis of community-acquired and hospital-associated canine viral infectious respiratory disease complex"}}
{"text":"Objectives The objectives were to collect baseline data on the occurrence, testing and vaccination practices, and clinical outcomes of feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) in New Zealand Methods A cross-sectional survey of 423 veterinary practices in New Zealand was performed to collect data on FeLV and FIV testing and vaccination during the 2015 calendar year. Clinical records from 572 cats tested using a point-of-care ELISA at a first-opinion veterinary practice between 7 April 2010 and 23 June 2016 were also obtained and multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to identify risk factors for test positivity. Survival times were estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results The survey was completed by 112 clinics (26.4%) of which 72 performed in-house testing. Of the 2125 tests performed, 56 (2.6%) were positive for FeLV and 393 (18.5%) were positive for FIV. Fewer than 1% of cats were vaccinated for FeLV, with veterinarians citing low perceived prevalence as the primary reason for not vaccinating. Being male compared with being female and having clinical evidence of immunosuppression were significant risk factors for both FeLV and FIV test positivity. The median survival times of FeLV and FIV test-positive cats were 10 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 0-16) and 650 days (95% CI 431-993), respectively. Conclusions and relevance Testing and vaccination for FeLV and FIV in New Zealand appears targeted towards high-risk animals, which may bias prevalence estimates. Baseline data should be monitored for changes in FeLV epidemiology now commercial vaccines are no longer available.","meta":{"paper_id":"52cc80efbb69d917fa6d4ad3f34f73124ea27ee8","title":"Epidemiology and clinical outcomes of feline immunodeficiency virus and feline leukaemia virus in client-owned cats in New Zealand"}}

Western blot and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to analyze mechanism of TRIM55 in cell migration and invasion. We found TRIM55 was downregulated in HCC tissues and was associated with prognosis of HCC patients. Cox regression analysis showed that TRIM55 was an independent risk factor of prognosis of HCC patients. Overexpression of TRIM55 was associated with lower cell migration and invasion ability, and it led to high expression of E-cadherin and low expression of Vimentin and MMP2. Our study found TRIM55 is an independent factor affecting the prognosis of HCC patients, and overexpression of TRIM55 inhibits migration and invasion of HCC cells through epithelial-mesenchymal transition and MMP2.","meta":{"paper_id":"f774e52f2267ee839ba5b026e12dfef588e15bfa","title":"Overexpression of Tripartite Motif Conaining 55 (TRIM55) Inhibits Migration and Invasion of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) Cells via Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) This work is licensed under Creative Common Attribution- NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)"}}
{"text":"Context: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a widespread pediatric disease caused primarily by human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). Objective: This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. Data Sources: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion\/exclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. Results: HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71\/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. Limitations: Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. Conclusions: Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps. Key Words: hand, foot and mouth disease, EV-A71, CV-A16, epidemiology (Pediatr Infect Dis J 2016;35:e285-e300) H and, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) has become an endemic childhood disease in East and Southeast Asia. Its main etiologic agents are human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus 16 (CV-A16). Although usually mild-with symptoms limited to >38\u00b0C fever, malaise, rashes on the volar regions of the hands and feet, herpangina and difficulty eating and drinking-more rarely, infection can lead to complications of the nervous or cardiopulmonary systems. Such cases can result in long-term sequelae such as cognitive and motor disorders 1,2 or death, usually from pulmonary edema or brainstem encephalitis. 3 Although complications are rare, the number of children being infected in high-incidence countries such as China (\u22482.7 M cases in 2014 3 ) means the death toll can be substantial (384 deaths in China in 2014 3 ). The EV-A71 virus seems to be responsible for more severe outcomes, while CV-A16 and other Coxsackieviruses, such as CV-A2, CV-A6 and CV-A10, usually present milder symptoms that resolve within a few weeks. [4] [5] [6] There are nearly 25 years of literature from Asia that describes the epidemiology of HFMD, drawing on pediatric cohorts, national surveillance systems, outbreak investigations and clinical data, and from disparate countries that span stages of economic development and with climates that range from tropical to temperate. This diversity complicates attempts to identify general features of HFMD epidemiology and conceals gaps in the body of knowledge of this important pediatric disease. The objective of this paper is to provide a robust systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD that informs public health policy making about HFMD epidemics. The review covers 3 major areas: (1) history and seasonality of HFMD, and the efforts in predictive modeling; (2) risk factors for infection, to guide control and (3) global epidemiologic parameters, such as the incubation period and basic reproduction number, which may determine the effectiveness of control policies.","meta":{"paper_id":"1430ebabc4bb953366b635cd4a8adf9956c2f86b","title":"Original StudieS"}}

To asses the risk factor related to clinical material, climatic condition and type of RT-PCR applied, cloacal swabs (CS), faeces, sera, bursa of Fabricius (BF), thymus (TH) and spleen (SP) and ileumcaeca region were collected from 30-day-old poults suffering of enteritis episode characterized as poult enteritis mortality syndrome (PEMS). The PEMS clinical features were characterized by watery to foamy faeces, light brown-yellow in colour and low mortality rate. Meteorological data (rainfall and relative humidity) observed during along the study presented monthly average temperature ranging from 39.3 and 31.2\u00baC, precipitation in rainy season from 40 to 270.3 mm\/month, and no rain during dry season. Simplex RT-PCR gave odds ratio (OR) values suggesting that ileum-caeca region is at higher chance (OR=1.9; p=0.9741) to have both viral RNA than faeces (OR=1.5; p=0.7319). However, multiplex RT-PCR showed 3.98 (p=0.89982) more chance to give positive results in faeces than CS at dry season. The major risk factors seem to be low rate of humidity and high temperatures at winter, probably responsible for spread, easily, the TCoV and TAstv-2 among the flocks. The positive results of both virus suggested that they can play an important role in enteric disorders, associated to low humidity and high temperatures frequently found in tropical countries.","meta":{"paper_id":"377786fe05588ea782213fcb92f39a6522f113bd","title":"EPIDEMIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF ASTROVIRUS AND CORONAVIRUS IN POULTS IN THE SOUTH EASTERN REGION OF BRAZIL"}}

{"text":"Background. Chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) is the major limiting factor for long-term survival in lung transplant recipients. Viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI) has been previously associated with CLAD development. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term effects of VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation in relation to CLAD development. Method. Ninety-eight patients undergoing lung transplantation were prospectively enrolled between 2009 and 2012. They were monitored for infections with predefined intervals and on extra visits during the first year, the total follow-up period ranged between 5 and 8 years. Nasopharyngeal swab and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were analyzed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction panel for respiratory pathogens. Data regarding clinical characteristics and infectious events were recorded. Results. Viral respiratory tract infection during the first year was identified as a risk factor for long-term CLAD development (P = 0.041, hazard ratio 1.94 [1.03-3.66]) in a time-dependent multivariate Cox regression analysis. We also found that coronavirus in particular was associated with increased risk for CLAD development. Other identified risk factors were acute rejection and cyclosporine treatment. Conclusions. This study suggests that VRTI during the first year after lung transplantation is associated with longterm CLAD development and that coronavirus infections in particular might be a risk factor.","meta":{"paper_id":"b7ab9571dc69783d3b84dc3c5a24656db182afb6","title":"Viral Respiratory Tract Infection During the First Postoperative Year Is a Risk Factor for Chronic Rejection After Lung Transplantation"}}
{"text":"Background: Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aims to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia. Methods: Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to three tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement\/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using chisquared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression. : Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9%) had improved\/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement\/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] years vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U =4.932, P =0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement\/stabilization group (27.3% vs. 3.0%, \uf063 2 =9.291, P =0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement\/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6]\u2103 vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]\u2103, U=2.057, P =0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5% vs. 20.9%, \uf063 2 =5.611, P=0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] breaths\/min vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths\/min, U=4.030, P=0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement\/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement\/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] mg\/L vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg\/L, U=1.315, P=0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement\/stabilization group (36.62\u00b16.60 g\/L vs. 41.27\u00b14.55 g\/L, U =2.843, P =0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement\/stabilization group (\uf063 2 =16.01, P=0.001 ). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (OR, 8.546; 95% CI: 1.628\uf02d44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95% CI: 1.577\uf02d25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95% CI: 1.036-78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95% CI: 1.942\uf02d40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95% CI: 1.098\uf02d50.000; P = 0.003) and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95% CI: 1.224\uf02d34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression. Conclusions: Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature on admission, respiratory failure, albumin, C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.","meta":{"paper_id":"e9457327ddb51cf3ceb3698660ff08f526a09d44","title":"Analysis of factors associated with disease outcomes in hospitalized patients with 2019 novel coronavirus disease"}}

{"text":"Studies examining Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs) in Emergency Department (EDs), particularly in rural and remote areas, are rare. This study aimed to examine the burden of ARIs among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children presenting to Western Australian (WA) EDs from 2002 to 2012. Method Using a retrospective population-based cohort study linking ED records to birth and perinatal records, we examined presentation rates for metropolitan, rural and remote Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children from 469,589 births. We used ED diagnosis information to categorise presentations into ARI groups and calculated age-specific rates. Negative binomial regression was used to investigate association between risk factors and frequency of ARI presentation. Overall 26% of presentations were for ARIs. For Aboriginal children, the highest rates were for those aged <12 months in the Great Southern (1,233 per 1,000 child-years) and Pilbara regions (1,088 per 1,000 child-years). Rates for non-Aboriginal children were highest in children <12 months in the Southwest and Kimberley (400 and 375 per 1,000 child-years respectively). Presentation rates for ARI in children from rural and remote WA significantly increased over time in all age groups <5 years. Risk factors for children presenting to ED with ARI were: male, prematurity, Caesarean delivery, and residence in the Kimberley region and lower socio-economic areas. Conclusion One-in-four ED presentations in WA children are for ARIs, representing a significant outof-hospital burden with some evidence of geographical disparity. Planned linkages with hospital discharge and laboratory detection data will aid in assessing the sensitivity and specificity of ARI diagnoses in ED. \u2022 This study demonstrates that emergency department presentation for acute respiratory infections is common in children and identifies population subgroups which utilise emergency services more frequently than others. \u2022 We have conducted a state-wide in-depth investigation into the diagnostic information available from the emergency department data systems with regard to respiratory infections and provided age-specific presentation rates by condition and by geographic location, which can inform future disease control strategies. \u2022 As emergency department location was not available the postcode of the child at birth was used to stratify data by location, which is a limitation of this study.","meta":{"paper_id":"8d612e0c4433db428f3e06657888d5296a43b653","title":"Complete List of Authors Geographical disparities in acute respiratory infections in Western Australian emergency departments and risk factors for presenting"}}
{"text":"Purpose: Wheezing following viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children <2 years of age is an important risk factor for the development of asthma later in life; however, not all children with viral LRTIs develop wheezing. This study investigated risk factors for the development of wheezing during viral LRTIs requiring hospitalization. Methods: The study included 142 children <2 years of age hospitalized for LRTIs with at least one virus identified as the cause and classified them into children diagnosed with LRTIs with wheezing (n=70) and those diagnosed with LRTIs without wheezing (n=72). Results: There were no significant differences in the viruses detected between the two groups. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that, after adjusting for potentially confounding variables including sex and age, the development of wheezing was strongly associated with parental history of allergic diseases (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 20.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.22-126.48), past history of allergic diseases (aOR, 13.95; 95% CI, 1.34-145.06), past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (aOR, 21.36; 95% CI, 3.77-120.88), exposure to secondhand smoke at home (aOR, 14.45; 95% CI, 4.74-44.07), and total eosinophil count (aOR, 1.01; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02). Conclusion: Past and parental history of allergic diseases, past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses, exposure to secondhand smoke at home, and total eosinophil count were closely associated with the development of wheezing in children <2 years of age who required hospitalization for viral LRTIs. Clinicians should take these factors into consideration when treating, counseling, and monitoring young children admitted for viral LRTIs.","meta":{"paper_id":"9b91bf56210db60e68b22d502496e4b20e80ff3f","title":"Clinical risk factors associated with the develop ment of wheezing in children less than 2 years of age who required hospitalization for viral lower respiratory tract infections"}}
{"text":"Objective: To assess virus-specific hospitalization rates, risk factors for illness severity, and seasonal trends in children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Setting: A government hospital serving low-and middle-income population in Amman, Jordan. Participants: Children under two years old hospitalized with fever and\/or respiratory symptoms (n=3168) from 3\/16\/2010-3\/31\/2013. Children with chemotherapy-associated neutropenia and newborns who had never been discharged after birth were excluded from the study. Outcome Measures: Hospitalization rates and markers of illness severity: admission to intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation (MV), oxygen therapy, length of stay (LOS), and death. Of the 3168 subjects, 2581 (82%) had at least one respiratory virus detected, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) being the most predominant pathogen isolated. During admission, 1013 (32%) received oxygen therapy, 284(9%) were admitted to ICU, 111(4%) were placed on MV, and 31(1%) children died. Oxygen therapy was higher in RSV only subjects compared to human rhinovirus only (42% vs 29%, p<0.001), adenovirus only (42% vs 21%, p<0.001), and human parainfluenza virus only (42% vs 23% p<0.001) subjects. Underlying medical condition was associated with oxygen therapy (aOR 1.95, 95% CI 1.49-2.56), ICU admission (aOR 2.51, 95%CI 1.71-3.68), MV (1.91, 95% CI 1.11-3.28), and longer LOS (aOR1.71, 95% CI 1.37-2.13). Similarly, younger age was associated with oxygen therapy (0.23, 95% CI 0.17-0.31), ICU admission (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.74), MV (0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.53), and longer LOS (aOR 0.47, 95% CI 0.38-0.59). Pneumonia was strongly associated with longer LOS (aOR 2.07, 95% CI 1.65-2.60), oxygen therapy (aOR 2.94, 95% CI 2.22-3.89), ICU admission (aOR 3.12, 95% CI 2.16-4.50), and MV (aOR 3.33, 95% CI 1.85-6.00). Virus-specific hospitalization rates ranged from 0.5-10.5 per 1000 children. Respiratory viruses are associated with severe illness in Jordanian children hospitalized with ARI. Prevention strategies such as extended breastfeeding, increased access to palivizumab and RSV vaccine development could help decrease hospitalization rates and illness severity, particularly in young children with underlying medical conditions. For peer review only -http:\/\/bmjopen.bmj.com\/site\/about\/guidelines.xhtml BMJ Open Bashir Hospital is one of the three major government hospitals in Amman, which is Jordan's largest city and capital. 12 It was estimated that during the study period, the hospital provided care for \u224855% of all children in Amman (author SF, unpublished data). Additionally, 17,557 children were admitted to the pediatric wards, 11,230 (64%) of whom were under two years of age. After consent, trained local research staff obtained blood either by heel stick or venipuncture, as well as nasal and throat swabs.

{"text":"Background: Burden of disease can be used to prioritize the healthcare budget allocation. We analyzed the research and development (R&D) budget of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) in 2018 and compared the results with those of the 2015 Korean National Burden of Disease (KNBD) study. Methods: The 2018 MOHW R&D Project integrated implementation plan was used to analyze the R&D budget of the MOHW. The budget was allocated according to the KNBD disease group and according to the budget lines. The allocated budget was compared with the economic burden and the disability adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2015. Also, for budget targets for risk factors, DALYs of attributable risk factors were compared with corresponding budgets. Results: In 2018, the MOHW major R&D budget of USD 435.1 million accounted for 3% of the total government budget. Within the disease specific R&D budget, 35.9% was allocated to communicable disease groups, 64.1% to non-communicable diseases, and 0% to injury and violence. Among level 2 disease groups, neoplasm was ranked first. Among risk factors, climate change and behavioral risk were targeted for R&D. Conclusions: It would be difficult to say that current R&D allocations focus to minimize the burden of disease. A mismatch was observed between the R&D budget and the burden of disease in terms of economic burden and DALYs. There was a similar finding for risk factors R&D. A novel approach for allocating government R&D funding that is based on the goal of minimizing the disease burden in the Korean population should be considered.","meta":{"paper_id":"7220982ea4592afc5109160c63d728f1fdaa8373","title":""}}
{"text":"Bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity. Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.","meta":{"paper_id":"b05c7d68086daf67e216e3df0ae0477343632d03","title":"Influence of age and body condition on astrovirus infection of bats in Singapore: An evolutionary and epidemiological analysis"}}

The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and of 7 other viruses in children for LRTI in 4 capitals from this region, and investigate their association with several risk factors, including meteorological data. From April 2012 to March 2013, 507 children, aged up to 24 months and hospitalized with LRTI in one of the participating centers at Aracaj\u00fa, Salvador, Recife, and Macei\u00f3, had a sample of nasopharyngeal aspirate collected and analyzed for the following viruses by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction followed by hybridization on low-density microarrays: RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, and coronavirus. The result was positive in 66.5% of cases, RSV was the most common virus (40.2%). Except for rhinovirus (17%), all other virus had frequency rates lower than 6%. Viral coinfections were detected in 13.8% of samples. Possible related risk factors for RSV infection were low age upon entry, attendance of daycare, low gestational age, and low educational level of the father. The relative frequency of viral infections was associated with increasing temperature and decreasing humidity separately, but the results also suggested both associated with increased frequency of RSV. Some of these findings differ from those reported for other regions in Brazil and may be used to guide policies that address LRTI.

{"text":"Background: Influenza viruses are among the major causes of serious human respiratory tract infection worldwide. In line with the high disease burden attributable to influenza, these viruses play an important, but often neglected, role in travel medicine. Guidelines and recommendations regarding prevention and management of influenza in travellers are scarce. Of special interest for travel medicine are risk populations and also circumstances that facilitate influenza virus transmission and spread, like travel by airplane or cruise ship and mass gatherings. Methods: We conducted a PUBMED\/MEDLINE search for a combination of the MeSH terms Influenza virus, travel, mass gathering, large scale events and cruise ship. In addition we gathered guidelines and recommendations from selected countries and regarding influenza prevention and management in travellers. By reviewing these search results in the light of published knowledge in the fields of influenza prevention and management, we present best practice advice for the prevention and management of influenza in travel medicine. Results: Seasonal influenza is among the most prevalent infectious diseases in travellers. Known host-associated risk factors include extremes of age and being immune-compromised, while the most relevant environmental factors are associated with holiday cruises and mass gatherings. Conclusions: Pre-travel advice should address influenza and its prevention for travellers, whenever appropriate on the basis of the epidemiological situation concerned. Preventative measures should be strongly recommended for travellers at high-risk for developing complications. In addition, seasonal influenza vaccination should be considered for any traveller wishing to reduce the risk of incapacitation, particularly cruise ship crew and passengers, as well as those participating in mass gatherings. Besides advice concerning preventive measures and vaccination, advice on the use of antivirals may be considered for some travellers.","meta":{"paper_id":"85e8b1143c1869125270527aa26d4e48ad63fb5b","title":"Travellers and influenza: risks and prevention"}}

{"text":"Objective: Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is caused by the rupture of small blood vessels and other health problems. In ICH patients, hematoma enlargement is the most critical risk factor for poor outcomes. Tranexamic acid, an anti-fibrinolytic agent, has been used to reduce hematoma expansion. We analyzed the risk factors for hematoma expansion in ICH patients and compared the predictability of hematoma expansion in ICH patients with the use of tranexamic acid. Methods: We performed retrospective analysis of ICH patients who underwent follow-up computed tomography scans from October 2008 to October 2018. Of the 329 included patients, 67 who received tranexamic acid and 262 who did not receive tranexamic acid were compared. We also analyzed the risk factors of 45 and 284 patients who did and did not experience hematoma expansion, respectively. Results: Hematoma expansion was observed in 7 (10.4%) of 67 patients in the tranexamic acid group and 38 (14.5%) of the 262 patients who did not receive tranexamic acid. There was no statistically significant difference between patients who did and did not received tranexamic acid (p=0.389). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis of risk factors for hematoma expansion, spot sign and a maximal diameter of 40 mm were identified as risk factors. Conclusion: We could not confirm the effect of tranexamic acid on hematoma expansion in ICH patients. Spot sign and the maximal diameter of hematomas were confirmed as risk factors of hematoma expansion. If the maximal diameter is greater than 40 mm, the hematoma should be closely monitored.","meta":{"paper_id":"8b965ccb656960174a81c75effed2a6f2315f0e7","title":""}}

An epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the transmission route of the infection and to control the outbreak. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study (Study 1) was conducted on students and teachers of the athletic departments using the swimming pool, and a prospective surveillance (Study 2) was conducted on all students and teachers of the School J. A case was defined as any student and school personnel who developed more than two of the following symptoms from April 10 to July 2, 2017: fever, sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, or headache. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated to compare the attack rates according to potential risk factors. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors for infection in the outbreak. Results: 47 cases were identified: 33 (55.9%) cases occurred among 59 students and teachers in Study 1 and 14 (3.9%) among 362 students and school personnel in Study 2. There were 18 laboratory confirmed adenovirus infection cases. The common symptoms were headache (71.7%), fever (69.6%), rhinorrhea (63.0%), sputum (56.5%), and sore throat (54.3%). 23.9% of the cases were accompanied with diarrhea and 19.6% with eye congestion. None of the cases developed pneumonia. 32.6% of the cases were hospitalized. In Study 1, attack rate in the swimming department was higher than that in others (RR: 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.60). In Study 2, being a member of the shooting department (RR: 20.70; 95% CI: 4.90 -87.47) and being a first year high school student (RR: 10.95; 95% CI: 2.90 -41.33) were identified as risk factors for the infections. Genetic analyses of the adenoviruses showed 100% identical sequence in homology and confirmed the human adenovirus B55 (HAdV-B55). No adenovirus was detected at examining the water and environment of the swimming pool and dormitory. Conclusion: The outbreak is inferred to be occurred via propagated transmission among the students in the same athletic department, while the students with symptoms of respiratory infection continued performing school activities without any restrictions. Infection control measures such as early detection of symptoms of respiratory infection and restriction of group activity are necessary to prevent respiratory infection outbreak in the communal living setting.","meta":{"paper_id":"c6aea56ae2d57157e5a84857bc2c166d6a9a0105","title":""}}
{"text":"Introduction: Hyponatraemia is the most common electrolyte imbalance seen in clinical practice, and a common laboratory finding in children with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP). This study aimed to identify the incidence of hyponatraemia in cases of CAP, to find predictive tools in order to classify the severity and outcome of CAP and to explore possible differences of clinical importance between the two sexes. Material and methods: The medical files of 54 children (66.4% males), 4.67 \u00b12.88 years old, were retro-prospectively reviewed. Results: 35\/54 (64.8%) children with pneumonia had normal values of sodium at admission, 18\/54 (33.3%) had mild hyponatraemia and 1 child (1.9%) moderate hyponatraemia. Increased heart rhythm and tachypnoea at admission were correlated with lower values of sodium (z = -2.664, p = 0.007 and z = -1.705, p = 0.089 respectively). No differences were found between the two sexes concerning the characteristics of pneumonia or the range of sodium in serum at admission. A correlation was found between sodium admission values and: a) C-reactive protein (p = 0.000), and b) leukocyte count (p = 0.006). Sedimentation rate (p = 0.021) was also considered as a possible risk factor affecting the value of sodium at admission to hospital. Finally, a negative association was also observed between the degree of hyponatraemia and the duration of hospitalization (z = -3.398, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Although studies in larger population groups are needed, in our study increased heart rhythm, tachypnoea, leucocyte count, C-reactive protein, and also erythrocyte sedimentation rate could be considered as possible risk factors influencing the degree of hyponatraemia, and thus the outcome of hospitalized children with CAP.","meta":{"paper_id":"51485c1b5e3ce7050422a81c6a16ed00faa768fd","title":"Hyponatraemia in cases of children with pneumonia"}}
{"text":"Background: Osteonecrosis is an incapacitating disorder with high morbidity. Though extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) provides a noninvasive treatment option, controversial subjects still exist about its effectiveness, indications, and mechanism of action. Methods: An electronic databases search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to collect clinical trials, case reports, and cases series on this topic and then useful data were extracted and appraised by experienced clinicians. We evaluated the quality of included evidences by using the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine (EBM) Levels of Evidence. Results: A total of 17 articles including 2 case reports, 9 open label trials, 2 cohorts, and 6 randomized controlled trials were considered to be eligible for this systematic review. Visual analog scale (VAS), Harris hip scores, and the imaging results were the frequently-used outcome estimates of included studies. Conclusion: By systematically analyzing these evidences, we could conclude that ESWT could act as a safe and effective method to improve the motor function and relieve the pain of patients with osteonecrosis of femoral hip, especially those at early stage. Imaging revealed that bone marrow edema was significantly relieved, but the necrotic bone could not be reversed after ESWT. This technique could slow or even block the progression of ONFH and therefore reduce the demand for surgery. Collaboration with other conservative modalities would not improve the curative benefits of ESWT. Meanwhile, ONFH with various risk factors showed similar reaction to this noninvasive treatment method. However, these conclusions should be interpreted carefully for the low-quality of included publications and further studies are requisite to validate the effect of ESWT in ONFH.

Administrative ED datasets were linked to birth and perinatal records. The objectives were to compare overall and age-specific ED ARIs rates among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in the different WA regions, monthly distribution and temporal trends, and to identify infant, maternal and socio-economic risk factors for ARI. The overall goal is to use such information to inform health service planning. Major findings. 26% of ED presentations were for ARIs. ARIs rates were highest in children <12 months for Aboriginal children (1,027.6 per 1000 child-years) and non-Aboriginal children (297.4 per 1000 child-years). Regional differences were observed, trend analysis revealed increase ARI rates for all children in rural and remote areas, and the strongest risk facts observed in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children were male sex, prematurity, caesarean delivery, birth in lower socio-economic areas and living in the Kimberley region. This manuscript provides strong ARI incidence rates in the ED for children residing in Western Australia, and highlights ARIs rates of 2 to 3 times higher in Aboriginal children compare to non-Aboriginal children as well as regional disparity.

{"text":"Background. The microbial etiology of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is often unclear in clinical practice, and previous studies have produced variable results. Population-based studies examining etiology and incidence are lacking. This study examined the incidence and etiology of CAP requiring hospitalization in a population-based cohort as well as risk factors and outcomes for specific etiologies. Methods. Consecutive admissions due to CAP in Reykjavik, Iceland were studied. Etiologic testing was performed with cultures, urine-antigen detection, and polymerase chain reaction analysis of airway samples. Outcomes were length of stay, intensive care unit admission, assisted ventilation, and mortality. Results. The inclusion rate was 95%. The incidence of CAP requiring hospitalization was 20.6 cases per 10 000 adults\/year. A potential pathogen was detected in 52% (164 of 310) of admissions and in 74% (43 of 58) with complete sample sets. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common pathogen (61 of 310, 20%; incidence: 4.1\/10 000). Viruses were identified in 15% (47 of 310; incidence: 3.1\/10 000), Mycoplasma pneumoniae were identified in 12% (36 of 310; incidence: 2.4\/10 000), and multiple pathogens were identified in 10% (30 of 310; incidence: 2.0\/10 000). Recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of M pneumoniae (P < .001), whereas a lack of recent antimicrobial therapy was associated with increased detection of S pneumoniae (P = .02). Symptoms and outcomes were similar irrespective of microbial etiology. Conclusions. Pneumococci, M pneumoniae, and viruses are the most common pathogens associated with CAP requiring hospital admission, and they all have a similar incidence that increases with age. Symptoms do not correlate with specific agents, and outcomes are similar irrespective of pathogens identified.","meta":{"paper_id":"2e45740f4d2001e92d14d657feef0191f769cb61","title":"Open Forum Infectious Diseases Incidence and Etiology of CAP \u2022 OFID \u2022 1 Open Forum Infectious Diseases \u00ae Incidence, Etiology, and Outcomes of Community- Acquired Pneumonia: A Population-Based Study"}}

{"text":"OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster has been widely described in the context of different systemic autoimmune diseases but not dermatomyositis\/polymyositis. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence, risk factors and herpes zoster outcomes in this population. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of herpes zoster infections in dermatomyositis\/polymyositis patients was performed. The patients were followed at a tertiary center from 1991 to 2012. For the control group, each patient with herpes zoster was paired with two patients without herpes zoster. Patients were matched by gender and the type of myositis, age at myositis onset and disease duration. RESULTS: Of 230 patients, 24 (10.4%) had a histories of herpes zoster (19 with dermatomyositis and five with polymyositis, two-thirds female). The mean age of the patients with herpes zoster was 44.6\u00a116.8 years. No difference between the groups was found regarding cumulative clinical manifestations. Disease activity, autoantibody, muscle and leukogram parameters were also comparable between the groups. No differences in immunosuppressive (alone or in association with other immunosuppressive therapies) or glucocorticoid (current use, medium dose and cumulative dose in the last two months) therapies were found between patients with and without herpes zoster. However, a higher proportion of patients in the herpes zoster group received chloroquine diphosphate compared to the control group. All of the patients received acyclovir; 58.3% of patients had postherpetic neuralgia and no cases of recurrence were reported. Furthermore, individuals who were taking high prednisone doses at the time of the herpes zoster diagnosis had reduced levels of postherpetic neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that chloroquine diphosphate could predispose patients with dermatomyositis\/polymyositis to developing herpes zoster, particularly women and dermatomyositis patients.","meta":{"paper_id":"2ff89400f9bff213ae066c12daa59d5a40fa6257","title":"Chloroquine diphosphate: a risk factor for herpes zoster in patients with dermatomyositis\/polymyositis"}}
{"text":"Background: The prevalence and risk factors for infection with enteropathogens in dogs frequenting dog parks have been poorly documented, and infected dogs can pose a potential zoonotic risk for owners. Hypothesis\/Objectives: To determine the prevalence and risk factors of infection with enteropathogens and zoonotic Giardia strains in dogs attending dog parks in Northern California and to compare results of fecal flotation procedures performed at a commercial and university parasitology laboratory. Animals: Three-hundred dogs attending 3 regional dog parks in Northern California. Methods: Prospective study. Fresh fecal specimens were collected from all dogs, scored for consistency, and owners completed a questionnaire. Specimens were analyzed by fecal centrifugation flotation, DFA, and PCR for detection of 11 enteropathogens. Giardia genotyping was performed for assemblage determination. Results: Enteropathogens were detected in 114\/300 dogs (38%), of which 62 (54%) did not have diarrhea. Frequency of dog park attendance correlated significantly with fecal consistency (P = .0039), but did not correlate with enteropathogen detection. Twenty-seven dogs (9%) were infected with Giardia, and genotyping revealed nonzoonotic assemblages C and D. The frequency of Giardia detection on fecal flotation was significantly lower at the commercial laboratory versus the university laboratory (P = .013), and PCR for Giardia was negative in 11\/27 dogs (41%) that were positive on fecal flotation or DFA. Conclusions and Clinical Importance: Enteropathogens were commonly detected in dogs frequenting dog parks, and infection with Giardia correlated with fecal consistency. PCR detection of Giardia had limited diagnostic utility, and detection of Giardia cysts by microscopic technique can vary among laboratories.","meta":{"paper_id":"d6951136eb1f783092f894b3d7c98e896cf3e921","title":"Prevalence of Enteropathogens in Dogs Attending 3 Regional Dog Parks in Northern California"}}
{"text":"Bats are unique mammals that are reservoirs of high levels of virus diversity. Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.","meta":{"paper_id":"3c9f18f46f3aef0543e0e61213dd187af135f87b","title":"Influence of age and body condition on astrovirus infection of bats in Singapore: An evolutionary and epidemiological analysis"}}
{"text":"Severe bronchiolitis is the most common reason for hospitalization among children younger than 2 years. This study analyzed the prevalence of community-acquired respiratory virus infection and the risk factors for hospitalization of Mexican children with severe bronchiolitis treated in an Emergency department. This retrospective study included 134 children 2 years or younger with severe viral bronchiolitis, and 134 healthy age-matched controls. The study period was September 2012 to January 2015. We determined the viral etiology and coinfections with multiple viruses and compared the risk factors detected in children with severe viral bronchiolitis with those in the control group. A total of 153 respiratory viruses in these 134 patients, single or mixed infections, were identified: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) type A or B was the most frequently detected (23.6% and 17.6%, respectively), followed by rhinovirus (RV; 16.3%) and parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 3 (12.4%). Coinfections of 2 respiratory viruses were found in 14.2% of cases; all cases had either RSV type A or B with another virus, the most common being parainfluenza virus or rhinovirus. Exposure to cigarette smoking was independently associated with hospitalization for severe bronchiolitis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.99-6.18; P = .0001), and having completed the vaccination schedule for their age was a protective factor against adverse outcome (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.35-0.87; P = .010). RSV is a common infection among young children with severe bronchiolitis; thus, developing a vaccine against RSV is essential. Campaigns to reinforce the importance of avoiding childhood exposure to cigarette smoke are also needed.

{"text":"Numerous viral infections have arisen and affected global healthcare facilities. Millions of people are at severe risk of acquiring several evolving viral infections through several factors. In the present article we have described about risk factors, chance of infection, and prevention methods of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), human coronaviruses (CoVs) frequently cause a normal cold which is mild and self-restricting. Zoonotic transmission of CoVs such as the newly discovered MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, may be associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection. The present review provides the recent clinical and pathological information on MERS and SARS. The task is to transform these discoveries about MERS and SARS pathogenesis and to develop intervention methods that will eventually allow the effective control of these recently arising severe viral infections. Global health sector has learnt many lessons through the recent outbreak of MERS and SARS, but the need for identifying new antiviral treatment was not learned. In the present article we have reviewed the literature on the several facets like transmission, precautions and effectiveness of treatments used in patients with MERS-CoV and SARS infections.","meta":{"paper_id":"1fe9d44383ae2debf062555ea05a816dd3848a91","title":"Challenges presented by MERS corona virus, and SARS corona virus to global health"}}
{"text":"OBJECTIVES: To determine the viruses and risk factors associated with hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in infants with acute bronchiolitis. INTRODUCTION: Bronchiolitis is a major cause of morbidity in infants. Widespread use of molecular-based methods has yielded new insights about its etiology, but the impact of viral etiologies on early outcomes is still unclear. METHODS: Seventy-seven infants with bronchiolitis who were under two years of age and visited an emergency unit were included. Using molecular-based methods, samples were tested for 12 different respiratory viruses. Logistic regression models were used to identify clinical and virological variables associated with the main endpoints: hospital admission and ICU admission. We identified at least one virus in 93.5% of patients, and coinfections were found in nearly 40% of patients. RSV was the most common pathogen (63.6%), followed by rhinovirus (39%). Identification of RSV was only associated with an increased risk of hospital admission in the univariate model. Younger age and enterovirus infection were associated with an increased risk of hospital admission, while atopy of a first-degree relative showed a protective effect. Prematurity was associated with an increased risk of admission to the ICU. Coinfections were not associated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular-based methods resulted in high rates of viral identification but did not change the significant role of RSV in acute bronchiolitis. Younger age and enterovirus infection were risk factors for hospital admission, while prematurity appeared to be a significant risk factor for admission to the ICU in acute viral bronchiolitis.","meta":{"paper_id":"924dc69ab73fbedf0c55ba2f7cd22e76710512ea","title":"High Rate of Viral Identification and Coinfections in Infants with Acute Bronchiolitis"}}
