The analysis of 97 the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a 98 significant negative association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine. Furthermore, the risk factors of 99 higher levels of IL-35 in patients of mycetoma revealed a significant negative 100 association with IL-12.

Results: Older age and high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS.

{"text":"Artificial nanoparticles accumulate a protein corona layer in biological fluids, which significantly influences their bioactivity. As nanosized obligate intracellular parasites, viruses share many biophysical properties with artificial nanoparticles in extracellular environments and here we show that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) accumulate a rich and distinctive protein corona in different biological fluids. Moreover, we show that corona pre-coating differentially affects viral infectivity and immune cell activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that viruses bind amyloidogenic peptides in their corona and catalyze amyloid formation via surface-assisted heterogeneous nucleation. Importantly, we show that HSV-1 catalyzes the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide (A\u03b242), a major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease, in-vitro and in animal models. Our results highlight the viral protein corona as an acquired structural layer that is critical for viral-host interactions and illustrate a mechanistic convergence between viral and amyloid pathologies. doi: bioRxiv preprint HSV-1 is an example of another virus with high prevalence, infecting nearly 70% of the human population 17 .

Latent HSV-1 is occasionally reactivated causing peripheral pathology and under certain circumstances it can migrate into the central nervous system causing herpes simplex encephalitis; the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis 19 . In the context of the current work we focused on the presumptive role of HSV-1 in the pathology of AD. A number of risk factors have been associated with AD, including the E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (Apo-E), diabetes, vascular pathology, neuroinflammation and infections 20 . Several recent studies have supported the theory of a significant role of HSV-1 in the disease 21 . HSV-1 DNA was found to be localized within amyloid plaques in AD patients and HSV-1 infection has been shown to promote neurotoxic A\u03b2 accumulation in human neural cells and to the formation of A\u03b2 deposits in the brains of infected mice 22,23 . Moreover, the presence of anti-HSV IgM antibodies, which indicate HSV reactivation, is correlated with a high risk of AD and antiherpetic treatment is correlated with a reduced risk of developing dementia 24,25 . Despite these correlations, the mechanism by which viruses induce amyloid aggregation, the major pathological hallmark of AD, is not known. In the present study, we demonstrated that upon encountering different biological fluids, RSV accumulated extensive and distinct protein coronae compared to HSV-1 and synthetic liposomes. The various coronae were dependent on the biological fluid and exerted markedly different effects on RSV infectivity and capacity to activate monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDCs). Moreover, upon interaction with an amyloidogenic peptide derived from IAPP, RSV accelerated the process of amyloid aggregation via surface-assisted heterogenous nucleation. This amyloid catalysis was also demonstrated for HSV-1 and the A\u03b242 peptide in-vitro and in an AD animal model. Our findings highlight the importance of viral protein corona interactions for viral pathogenesis and provide a direct mechanistic link between viral and amyloid pathologies. Results Based on the extensive literature describing the significant role of corona factors in synthetic nanoparticle functionality, we used established techniques to answer questions regarding RSV pathogenicity 26 . Using proteomics, we assessed the RSV protein corona profiles in adult human plasma (HP), juvenile (6 months old infants tested RSV negative at the time of sample collection) human plasma (jHP), human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from healthy adults, rhesus macaque plasma (MP), and fetal bovine serum (FBS). These biological fluids represent different microenvironments encountered by the virus in terms of tissue tropism (HP vs. BALF), zoonosis (MP) and culturing conditions (FBS). The biological fluids were screened for antibodies against RSV using ELISA, and both adult HP and BALF contained high levels of anti-RSV IgG antibodies, unlike jHP, MP and FBS (Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Viral stocks were produced in serum-free conditions to prevent initial contamination with FBS proteins. Virions produced under serum-free conditions were incubated with 10% v/v solutions of different biological fluids. Controls included non-infected cell medium representing the background cellular secretome, and synthetic lipid vesicles of a size comparable to RSV (200 nm) with positively or negatively charged surfaces. In addition, we compared the coronae of RSV to HSV-1 to probe for differences between different viruses of relatively similar size. After incubation for 1 h at 37 \u02daC, the virions were re-harvested by centrifugation and washed twice before performing mass spectrometry-based proteomic analyses. Six replicates from two independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 7 software. The detection of specific anti-RSV IgG antibodies in biological fluids was performed using Human Anti-Respiratory syncytial virus IgG ELISA Kit (ab108765, abcam\u00ae, Sweden), according to manufacturer's protocol. All biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) were diluted to a protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml before performing the assay and results were compared to the positive, cutoff, and negative controls provided by the kit manufacturer. HEp-2 cells were seeded in maintenance medium until they reached 50-60% confluency. On the day of infection, the cells were washed twice with warm PBS and medium was changed to VP-SFM with gentamycin. Before adding to the cells, sucrose cushion-concentrated RSV stocks were pre-incubated with different biological fluids (FBS, HP, MP, BALF) at a final protein concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in VP-SFM with 10 mM sodium citrate for 1 h at 37 \u02daC. The corona-precoated viruses were then added to the cells in serum-free conditions (diluted 10x) at a MOI of 1. 24h post-infection, the medium was changed back to growth medium and cells were visualized with fluorescence microscopy 72h post-infection. After visualization, the cells were washed and stained with LIVE/DEAD\u2122 Fixable Far Red Dead Cell Stain Kit (ThermoFisher, USA) for 30 min at 4 \u02daC in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS no calcium, no magnesium, ThermoFisher), then fixed and washed for flow cytometry using Cytofix/Cytoperm\u2122 (BD, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Cells were then scraped and resuspended in DPBS, and the data was acquired using MACSQuant\u00ae Analyser 10 flowcytometer (Miltenyi Biotec, Sweden). The data was analyzed by FlowJo software (TreeStar) by excluding the dead cells stained with far-red fluorescent dye and subsequent calculation of GFP positive cells within the viable cell population. For experiments with palivizumab, cells were treated with different concentrations of the antibody before infection. Human monocytes were negatively selected from buffy coats using the RosetteSep Monocyte Enrichment Kit (1mL/10mL buffy coat; StemCell Technologies) and differentiated into moDC, using GM-CSF (250ng/mL; PeproTech) and IL-4 (6.5ng/mL; R&D Systems) for 6 days in 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 at a density of 5x10 5 cells/mL in RPMI 1640 completed with 10% FCS, 1mM sodium pyruvate, 10mM HEPES, 2mM L-glutamine, and 1% and penicillin/streptomycin (ThermoFisher, USA). Immature moDC were exposed to RSV pre-incubated with different biological fluids for 4h in serum free media, washed and then incubated in serum containing medium for 72 h before analyses of CD86 and RSV-GFP expression. Dead cells were excluded using Live/Dead fixable near-IR dead cell stain kit (ThermoFisher). Flow cytometry sample data were acquired on a Fortessa (BD Biosciences) and the analysis was performed in FlowJo software (TreeStar). NNFGAIL, GNNQQNY, A\u03b242, A\u03b240 were synthesized and purified by Pepscan (The Netherlands) and the final molecular weight was verified by MS. 10 \u00b5l of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (ThermoFisher, USA) were added to .","meta":{"paper_id":"1c06378f629bfa8870c89b3abfdecfc19db9b459","title":"The Viral Protein Corona Directs Viral Pathogenesis and Amyloid Aggregation","score":0.5,"pattern":5},"_input_hash":282107288,"_task_hash":1492325147,"spans":[{"text":"diabetes","start":2195,"end":2203,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":785768137,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of severe respiratory disease in infants. Other than age at the time of infection, the causes and correlates of severe illness in infants lacking known risk factors are poorly defined. We recruited a cohort of confirmed RSV-infected infants and simultaneously assayed the presence of resident airway microbiota and the molecular status of their airways using a novel method. Rigorous statistical analyses identified a molecular airway gene expression signature of severe illness dominated by excessive chemokine expression. Global 16S rRNA sequencing confirmed an association between H. influenzae and clinical severity. Interestingly, adjusting for H. influenzae in our gene expression analysis revealed an association between severity and airway lymphocyte accumulation. Exploring the relationship between airway gene expression and the time of onset of clinical symptoms revealed a robust, acute activation of interferon (IFN) signaling, which was absent in subjects with severe illness. Finally, we explored the relationship between IFN activity, airway gene expression and productive RSV infection using a novel in vitro model of bona fide pediatric human airway epithelial cells. Interestingly, blocking IFN signaling, but not IFN ligand production, in these cells leads to increased viral infection. Our data reveal that acute airway interferon responses are physiologically relevant in the context of infant RSV infection and may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Additionally, the airway gene expression signature we define may be useful as a biomarker for efficacy of intervention responses. All rights reserved.

{"text":"The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV. : medRxiv preprint GO biological process annotation gmt file was downloaded from MSigDB (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/). GSEA was performed to analyze the possible biological processes related to ACE2 in healthy people using clusterProfiler (12) . The parameters were nPerm = 1000, minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500, the biological processes with p-value < 0.05 were considered significant. GSVA was performed using GSVA R package. The immune infiltrating was quantified using the ssGSEA method in GSVA R package. The gene list for immune cells was derived from Bindea G et al.(13).

{"text":"The 2019-nCoV is reported to share the same entry (ACE2) as SARS-CoV according to the updated findings. Analyzing the distribution and expression level of the route of coronavirus may help reveal underlying mechanisms of viral susceptibility and post-infection modulation. In this study, we found that the expression of ACE2 in healthy populations and patients with underlying diseases was not significantly different, suggesting relatively similar susceptibility. Besides, based on the expression of ACE2 in smoking individuals, we inferred that long-term smoking might be a risk factor for 2019-nCoV. Analyzing the ACE2 in SARS-CoV infected cells suggested that ACE2 was more than just a receptor but also participated in post-infection regulation, including immune response, cytokine secretion, and viral genome replication. Moreover, we also constructed Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and identified hub genes in viral activity and cytokine secretion. Our findings may explain the clinical symptoms so far and help clinicians and researchers understand the pathogenesis and design therapeutic strategies for 2019-nCoV. : medRxiv preprint GO biological process annotation gmt file was downloaded from MSigDB (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/). GSEA was performed to analyze the possible biological processes related to ACE2 in healthy people using clusterProfiler (12) . The parameters were nPerm = 1000, minGSSize = 10, maxGSSize = 500, the biological processes with p-value < 0.05 were considered significant. GSVA was performed using GSVA R package. The immune infiltrating was quantified using the ssGSEA method in GSVA R package. The gene list for immune cells was derived from Bindea G et al.(13).

Individuals carrying rhinovirus and H. influenzae-S. pneumoniae together were respectively twice and five times more likely to have respiratory symptoms. Individual with H. influenzae-K. pneumoniae carriage were twice (p = 0.04) as likely to develop a cough. The use of disposable handkerchiefs was associated with a decrease in the acquisition of S. aureus (aRR = 0.75, 95%CI [0.57-0.97]). Results could be used to identify pilgrims at increased risk of RTIs and acquisition of respiratory pathogens. Results also confirm the effectiveness of influenza and IPD vaccinations in reducing ILI symptoms and acquisition of S. pneumoniae carriage respectively. The Hajj is one of the largest annual religious mass gatherings in the world. Each year, Saudi Arabia attracts over 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries, including about 2,000 from Marseille, France 1 . The Hajj presents major challenges in public health and infection control as the crowding conditions favor the acquisition, dissemination and transmission of pathogenic microorganisms 2 . Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are particularly frequent during the pilgrimage and are responsible for most causes of hospitalization, with community-acquired pneumonia being a major cause of serious illness among pilgrims 3 . Many studies have been conducted among Hajj pilgrims over the last decade, demonstrating the high prevalence of respiratory symptoms and the frequent acquisition of respiratory pathogens 3-7 . The viruses most commonly acquired after the Hajj are human rhinovirus (HRV), human coronaviruses (HCoV) and influenza A virus (IAV). The most frequently acquired respiratory bacteria are Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) 3 . However, the etiology of RTIs at the Hajj is likely multifactorial and complex. The potential effects of vaccination against influenza and pneumococcus 8,9 , of non-pharmaceutical preventive measures including face-mask use and hand hygiene practice 10-12 have been investigated, mostly based on clinical criteria, but results of studies are contradictory. So far, to our knowledge, risk factors for pathogen acquisition during the Hajj are not clearly identified. Relationship between respiratory symptoms and carriage of respiratory pathogens at the Hajj also remain poorly understood making it difficult distinguishing between infection and colonization. We conducted this www.nature.com/scientificreports www.nature.com/scientificreports/ study to identify risk factors for respiratory symptoms and respiratory pathogens carriage at the Hajj, including socio-demographics, vaccination against influenza and invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPD) and adherence to non-pharmaceutical preventive measures using data collected from 2014 to 2017.

{"text":"Background: As of 31 st March 2010, more than 127,000 confirmed cases of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), including 800 deaths, were reported in mainland China. The distribution and characteristics of the confirmed cases in the initial phase of this pandemic in this country are largely unknown. The present study aimed to characterize the geographic distribution and patient characteristics of H1N1 infection in the 2009 pandemic as well as to identify potential risk factors associated with adverse patient outcome in China, through retrospective analyses of 885 hospitalized cases with confirmed H1N1 infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: The proportional hazards model was employed to detect risk factors for adverse outcome; the geo-statistical maps were used to characterize the distribution of all 2668 confirmed H1N1 patients throughout mainland China. The number of new cases increased slowly in May, 2009, but rapidly between June and August of the year. Confirmed cases were reported in 26 provinces; Beijing, Guangdong, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Fujian were the top five regions of the incidence of the virus infection. After being adjusted for gender, age, chronic pulmonary disease and other general symptoms, delay for more than two days before hospital admission (HR: 0.6; 95%CI: 0.5-0.7) and delayed onset of the H1N1-specific respiratory symptoms (HR: 0.3; 95%CI: 0.2-0.4) were associated with adverse patient outcome. Conclusions/Significance: The 2009 pandemic influenza A affected east and southeast coastal provinces and most populous cities more severely than other regions in mainland China due to higher risk of high level traffic-, high population density-, and high population mobility-associated H1N1 transmission.The clinical symptoms were mild in the initial phase of infection. Delayed hospital admission and delayed appearance of respiratory symptoms were among the major risk factors for poor patient outcome. These findings may have significant implications in the future pandemic preparedness and response.","meta":{"paper_id":"3ec7aa1d4381bbaa7f5fa69fa8eb7cc1d90a39f1","title":"Geographic Distribution and Risk Factors of the Initial Adult Hospitalized Cases of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in Mainland China","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-1422214706,"_task_hash":1453382288,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1168,"end":1171,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Human cathepsin L belongs to the cathepsin family of proteolytic enzymes with primarily an endopeptidase activity. Although its primary functions were originally thought to be only of a housekeeping enzyme that degraded intracellular and endocytosed proteins in lysosome, numerous recent studies suggest that it plays many critical and specific roles in diverse cellular settings. Not surprisingly, the dysregulated function of cathepsin L has manifested itself in several human diseases, making it an attractive target for drug development. Unfortunately, several redundant and isoform-specific functions have recently emerged, adding complexities to the drug discovery process. To address this, a series of chemical biology tools have been developed that helped define cathepsin L biology with exquisite precision in specific cellular contexts. This review elaborates on the recently developed small molecule inhibitors and probes of human cathepsin L, outlining their mechanisms of action, and describing their potential utilities in dissecting unknown function. Molecules 2020, 25, 698 2 of 41 also now well established and has been a subject of elegant reviews elsewhere [25] [26] [27] . Unfortunately, several overlapping and redundant functions of cathepsin L have also emerged [5, [28] [29] [30] . It is therefore critically important that its functional biology in both normal and disease-specific cell types be clearly annotated before significant resources are directed in drug discovery endeavors. In this review, we will briefly outline the biogenesis of cathepsin L, describe its post-translational processing and trafficking, and highlight key structural features required for formation of an active and mature cathepsin L. A brief summary of cathepsin L biology and its role in human diseases is provided next. Finally, a detailed and up-to-date report on existing cathepsin L-targeting small molecule inhibitors and functional probes with their mechanistic details is described. Human cathepsin L gene, CTHL (Uniprot primary accession number: P07711), located at the 9q21-q22 position of chromosome 9, encodes for a total of 333 amino acid peptide sequence (M.W. = 37,564 kDa) [31] . The coding space includes the regions of a N-terminal signal peptide, two pro-peptides, and two mature peptides comprising of a heavy (H) chain and a light (L) chain ( Figure 1 ). After transcription, the signal peptide is co-translationally removed in polysome and the resulting 41 kDa pro-cathepsin L is translocated to endoplasmic reticulum where it undergoes N-linked glycosylation with mannose rich sugars. The mannose sugars on the pro-cathepsin L are then phosphorylated in cis Golgi by UDP-N-acetylglucosamine:N-acetylglucosaminephosphotransferase enzyme [32] . The mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors located on the surface of the trans Golgi network recognize the M6P-pro-cathepsin peptide and deliver the pro-cathepsin L peptide to the lysosome via the endolysosomal pathway. The weakly acidic environment of endosome/lysosome releases M6P receptors and the phosphate group from mannose sugars is removed by a lysosomal acid phosphatase [33, 34] . Activation to mature cathepsin L form then occurs by removal of propeptides either by autocatalysis [35] or by aspartyl cathepsin D in the acidic environment of lysosome [36] . This leads to the double chain form of mature and active cathepsin L, comprising of H and L domains, connected by disulfide bridges, (Figure 2 ). It is to be noted here that several isoforms of cathepsin L have also been observed in specific cell types due to alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts and alternative translation [4, [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] .

At specific cellular locations, they seem to play pivotal roles in a wide range of functional activities. In addition to the degradation of cellular proteins by the endolysosomal pathway, cathepsin L also participates in the autophagic degradation pathway; it specifically degrades two autophagosomal markers, LC3-II and GABARAP-II [57] . The specialized podocyte cells in the kidney play a critical role in the retention of various proteins required to be maintained in blood plasma [58] . It was shown that the cytoplasmic variant of active cathepsin L can degrade two key proteins, GTPase dynamin and synaptopodin, required for podocyte's proper glomerular filtration function [23, 59, 60] . Consistently, a higher podocyte cathepsin L expression was found in a variety of proteinuric kidney diseases, and its functional inhibition (e.g., by creating cathepsin L resistant dynamin) led to reversing of the symptoms [23, 61] . Interestingly, a nuclear isoform of cathepsin L is associated with another unique function in kidney cells; it is involved in the proteolytic processing of Cux1, a cell cycle regulatory transcription factor that promotes cell proliferation and polycystic kidney disease (PKD) [62, 63] . Indeed, in mouse model of PKD, a lower level of nuclear cathepsin L was corelated with an increased level of Cux1 protein in cysts [62] . Another type of cells where cathepsin L seems to play a major role in maintaining homeostasis is cardiomyocytes [17, [64] [65] [66] [67] . Early investigation by Stypmann et al. on a year old Ctsl\u2212/\u2212 mice showed that they developed many key traits of dilated cardiomyopathy, such as interstitial myocardial fibrosis, cardiac chamber dilation, and impaired contraction. In addition, the newborn Ctsl\u2212/\u2212 mice acquired increased number of acidic organelles, although with altered morphology and function. These studies indicate that the inhibition of cathepsin L activity in these cells is detrimental to the proper functioning of cardiac cells. This was further corroborated by an overexpression study of cathepsin L in mice cardiomyocytes that exhibited cardioprotective effect by inhibiting the Akt signaling pathway [68] . The function of secreted extracellular cathepsin L in cardiac remodeling and repair has also been studied extensively since it is known that many proteins of extracellular matrix (ECM) are also the physiological substrate of cathepsin L; these include laminin, collagen type I, IV and XVIII,. Ischemic heart disease is major risk factor for diabetic patients, unable to maintain their sugar levels efficiently. During cardiac repair, endothelial progenitor cells containing elevated levels of cathepsin L home on ischemic cells, and initiate the process of neovascularization [72] [73] [74] . In uncontrolled diabetic condition however, cathepsin L function in ECM space during neovascularization is significantly impaired; this hampers the ischemic repair process [15, 75] . Controlled release of trypsinogen from pancreatic acinar cells and its subsequent activation in duodenum is a critically important event and must be tightly regulated. Dysregulated release of activated trypsin results in an acute pancreatitis condition. While cathepsin B efficiently cleaves trypsinogen to produce enhanced levels of active trypsin promoting pancreatitis, cathepsin L acts a regulatory brake, and keeps the activation process under control. And it does so by cleaving trypsinogen at a distinct site, 3 amino acids C terminal to cathepsin B, thereby inactivating trypsinogen itself [76] . Consistently, Ctsl\u2212/\u2212 mice showed increased trypsin activity in pancreas and surprisingly reduced pancreatitis due to diminished inflammation; this effect was attributed due to enhanced apoptosis of acinar cells (vs necrosis). In neuro-and immuno-biology, cathepsin L has important documented roles as well [77] [78] [79] [80] . For example, regulated secretory vesicles of the neuroendocrine system, such as chromaffin granules, house many mature function-ready enkephalin opioid peptides. Upon appropriate signaling stimuli, the activated enkephalin neuropeptides are secreted and released imparting their analgesic and immune-cell specific functions. Studies by Yasothornsrikul et al. revealed that cathepsin L is the proteolytic processing enzyme that renders active metenkephalin from proenkephalin [81] . In another studies, the severity of symptoms due to antigen-induced arthritis (AAI) was significantly reduced in Ctsl\u2212/\u2212 mice due to a weakened T helper cell population in thymus [82] . Molecules 2020, 25, 698 5 of 41 The expression of cathepsin L is highly dysregulated in several human diseases, including diabetes, AAI, abdominal aortic aneurysm, liver fibrosis, and cancers [13, [82] [83] [84] [85] . Its involvement in numerous forms of highly invasive cancers is particularly noteworthy and is covered in great detail in recent reviews [25, 26, [86] [87] [88] . Early studies by Gottesman revealed that extracellular cathepsin L levels can increase up to 200-fold in transformed cells [89] . In the ECM environment, they can rapidly degrade several structural components and significantly increase the migratory/invasive potential of these cells, promoting metastasis [86, 87] . Not surprisingly, cathepsin L inhibition by small molecule is considered a viable strategy for the development of novel anti-cancer agents.

Despite the clinical importance of feline retroviruses and the growing interest in cats as pets, information about FeLV and FIV in Malaysia is presently insufficient to properly advise veterinarians and pet owners. A cross-sectional study was carried out from January 2010 to December 2010 to determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with FeLV and FIV among domestic cats in peninsular Malaysia. Plasma samples were harvested from the blood of 368 domestic cats and screened for evidence of FeLV p27 antigen and FIV antibodies, using an immunochromatographic kit.

Results: Of the 368 cats that were evaluated in this study, 12.2% (45/368; 95% CI = 8.88 -15.58) were positive for FeLV p27 antigen, 31.3%, (115/368; 95% CI = 26.51 -35.99) were seropositive to FIV antibodies, and 4.3% (16/368; 95% CI = 2.27 -6.43) had evidence of both viruses.

{"text":"Objective: This study was designed to estimate the prevalence of E. coli which is the main cause of colisepticemia and the potential risk factors associated with the disease. A total of 74 calves less than 6 months age were selected for this study. For isolation and identification of E. coli, bacterial culture and biochemical tests were used. Result: Out of 74 calves selected for this study, 6 (8.11%) were positive for septicemic E. coli. Higher prevalence of 5 (8.93%) was recorded in Holstein Friesian breed than Boran breed 1 (5.56%). However, breed showed no significant difference on E. coli infections (P > 0.05). Higher prevalence of E. coli revealed below age of 30 days (17.39%) than calves aged between 30 and 90 days (8.33%) and above 90 days (0.00%). However, statistical association showed no difference (P > 0.05). Parity showed a significant difference in prevalence of E. coli (P < 0.05) in which infection increased with number of parity.

{"text":"Background: Febrile seizures are common in young children. Annual peaks in incidence mirror increased respiratory virus activity during winter. Limited virological data are available using modern diagnostic techniques for children with febrile seizures. We aimed to determine the frequency of detection of specific viral pathogens in children with febrile seizures, to describe risk factors including recent vaccination and clinical features associated with specific etiologies. Methods: An observational study was performed. Children aged 6 months to 5 years presenting to the Emergency Department of a tertiary children's hospital in Western Australia with febrile seizures were enrolled between March 2012 and October 2013. Demographic, clinical data and vaccination history were collected, and virological testing was performed on per-nasal and per-rectal samples. Results: One hundred fifty one patients (72 female; median age 1.7y; range 6 m-4y9m) were enrolled. Virological testing was completed for 143/151 (95%). At least one virus was detected in 102/143 patients (71%). The most commonly identified were rhinoviruses (31/143, 22%), adenovirus (30/151, 21%), enteroviruses, (28/143, 20%), influenza (19/143, 13%) and HHV6 (17/143, 12%). More than one virus was found in 48/143 (34%). No significant clinical differences were observed when children with a pathogen identified were compared with those with no pathogen detected. Febrile seizures occurred within 14 days of vaccine administration in 16/151 (11%). Conclusion: At least one virus was detected in over two thirds of cases tested (commonly picornaviruses, adenovirus and influenza). Viral co-infections were frequently identified.

This systematic review aims to compile and analyse all published data on MERS-coronavirus (CoV) in the global camel population to provide an overview of current knowledge on the distribution, spread and risk factors of infections in dromedary camels. We included original research articles containing laboratory evidence of MERS-CoV infections in dromedary camels in the field from 2013 to April 2018. In general, camels only show minor clinical signs of disease after being infected with MERS-CoV. Serological evidence of MERS-CoV in camels has been found in 20 countries, with molecular evidence for virus circulation in 13 countries. The seroprevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies increases with age in camels, while the prevalence of viral shedding as determined by MERS-CoV RNA detection in nasal swabs decreases. In several studies, camels that were sampled at animal markets or quarantine facilities were seropositive more often than camels at farms as well as imported camels vs. locally bred camels. Some studies show a relatively higher seroprevalence and viral detection during the cooler winter months. Knowledge of the animal reservoir of MERS-CoV is essential to develop intervention and control measures to prevent human infections.","meta":{"paper_id":"5a57a6330daa19227fb5011f690e68accf1c4b1d","title":"Epidemiology and Infection Global status of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in dromedary camels: a systematic review","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-702517815,"_task_hash":504838112,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":814,"end":817,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Background: Initial reports in May 2009 of the novel influenza strain H1N1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease. Methods/Principal Findings: We examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdminfected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniaepositive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p,0.0001). Conclusions/Significance: The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.

Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed sympatric wolf, coyote (Canis latrans), and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) serologic data from YNP, spanning 1991-2007, to identify long-term patterns of pathogen exposure, identify associated risk factors, and examine evidence for disease-induced mortality among wolves for which there were survival data. We found high, constant exposure to canine parvovirus (wolf seroprevalence: 100%; coyote: 94%), canine adenovirus-1 (wolf pups [0.5-0.9 yr]: 91%, adults [$1 yr]: 96%; coyote juveniles [0.5-1.5 yrs]: 18%, adults [$1.6 yrs]: 83%), and canine herpesvirus (wolf: 87%; coyote juveniles: 23%, young adults [1.6-4.9 yrs]: 51%, old adults [$5 yrs]: 87%) suggesting that these pathogens were enzootic within YNP wolves and coyotes. An average of 50% of wolves exhibited exposure to the protozoan parasite, Neospora caninum, although individuals' odds of exposure tended to increase with age and was temporally variable. Wolf, coyote, and fox exposure to canine distemper virus (CDV) was temporally variable, with evidence for distinct multi-host outbreaks in 1999 and 2005, and perhaps a smaller, isolated outbreak among wolves in the interior of YNP in 2002. The years of high wolf-pup mortality in 1999 and 2005 in the northern region of the park were correlated with peaks in CDV seroprevalence, suggesting that CDV contributed to the observed mortality. Conclusions/Significance: Of the pathogens we examined, none appear to jeopardize the long-term population of canids in YNP. However, CDV appears capable of causing short-term population declines. Additional information on how and where CDV is maintained and the frequency with which future epizootics might be expected might be useful for future management of the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population.","meta":{"paper_id":"335b0a3f21f764adcbe20ff71e422d823c410098","title":"A Serological Survey of Infectious Disease in Yellowstone National Park's Canid Community","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-172870414,"_task_hash":1348738645,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1208,"end":1211,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Presence of ducks, and in particular of free-grazing ducks, has consistently been shown to be one of the most important risk factors for highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks which has compromised poultry production in South-East Asia since the early 2000s and continues to threaten public health, farmers' livelihood and food security. Although freegrazing duck production has been practised for decades in South-East Asia, there are few published studies describing this production system, which is suspected to play an important role in the maintenance of avian influenza viruses. This study aimed at describing quantitatively the long-distance free-grazing duck production system in South Vietnam, characterising the movement and contact patterns of the duck flocks, and identifying potential associations between farming practices, movement and contact patterns and the circulation of avian influenza viruses. We conducted interviews among stakeholders involved in the free-grazing duck production system (duck farmers, transporters and rice paddy owners) in combination with a virological cross-sectional survey in South Vietnam. Results show that both direct and indirect contacts between free-grazing duck flocks were frequent and diverse. The flocks were transported extensively across district and province boundaries, mainly by boat but also by truck or on foot. A third of the investigated flocks had a positive influenza A virology test, indicating current circulation of avian influenza viruses, but none were positive for H5 subtypes. The age and size of the flock as well as its location at the time of sampling were associated with the risk of influenza A circulation in the flocks. These findings should be considered when developing risk assessment models of influenza virus spread aimed at informing the development of improved biosecurity practices leading to enhanced animal health, sustainable animal production and reliable income for farmers.","meta":{"paper_id":"589fe7dd846e7bbab5e7d6dacf7fab2ca6c4f340","title":"Movement and contact patterns of long- distance free-grazing ducks and avian influenza persistence in Vietnam","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-1652880043,"_task_hash":-1036956415,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1560,"end":1563,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

{"text":"Background: Hepatitis A (HA) is a low-incidence, non-endemic disease in Canada and the United States (US). However, a large difference in HA incidence between Canada and HA-endemic countries has made travel an important contributor to hepatitis A prevalence in Canada. There is also a (smaller) incidence differential between Canada and the US. Although the US has only moderately higher HA incidence, the volume of travel by Canadians to the US is many times higher than travel volume to endemic countries. Hence, travel to the US may constitute a source of low to moderate risk for Canadian travelers. To our knowledge, travel to the US has never been included as a potential risk factor for HA infection in Canadian epidemiologic analyses. The objective of this study was to use dynamic models to investigate the possible effects on hepatitis A incidence in Canada due to (1) implementing vaccination in the US, and (2) varying the volume of travel by Canadians to the US. We developed and analyzed age-structured compartmental models for the transmission and vaccination of hepatitis A, for both Canada and the US. Models were parameterized using data on seroprevalence, case reporting, and travel patterns. The potential effect of hepatitis A prevalence in the US on hepatitis A prevalence in Canada was captured through a term representing infection of Canadians due to travel in the US. The model suggests that approximately 22% of HA cases in Canada in the mid 1990s may have been attributable to travel to the US. A universal vaccination programme that attained 70% coverage in young children in the US in the mid 1990s could have reduced Canadian incidence by 21% within 5 years. Since not all necessary data were available to parameterize the model, the results should be considered exploratory. However, the analysis shows that, under plausible assumptions, the US may be more important for determining HA prevalence in Canada than is currently supposed. As international travel continues to grow, making vaccination policies ever more relevant to populations beyond a country's borders, such multi-country models will most likely come into wider use as predictive aids for policy development.","meta":{"paper_id":"f40d65d9dcb0b71bd266e62f77bc51d4c449eed1","title":"BMC Infectious Diseases The United States and Canada as a coupled epidemiological system: An example from hepatitis A","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":663336320,"_task_hash":-1430866086,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1002,"end":1005,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP), a high fatality condition causing haemorrhages in calves aged less than 4 weeks, was first reported in 2007 in Germany and subsequently observed at low incidence in other European countries and New Zealand. A multi-country matched case-control study was conducted in 2011 to identify calf-level risk factors for BNP. 405 BNP cases were recruited from 330 farms in Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands by laboratory confirmation of farmer-reported cases. Up to four calves of similar age from the same farm were selected as controls (1154 calves). Risk factor data were collected by questionnaire. Multivariable modelling using conditional logistic regression indicated that PregSureHBVD (PregSure, Pfizer Animal Health) vaccination of the dam was strongly associated with BNP cases (adjusted matched Odds Ratio -amOR 17.8 first lactation dams; 95% confidence interval -ci 2.4, 134.4; p = 0.005), and second or more lactation PregSure-vaccinated dams were more likely to have a case than first lactation vaccinated dams (amOR 2.2 second lactation; ci 1.1, 4.3; p = 0.024; amOR 5.3 third or more lactation; ci 2.9, 9.8; p = ,0.001). Feeding colostrum from other cows was strongly associated with BNP if the dam was not PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 30.5; ci 2.1, 440.5; p = 0.012), but the effect was less if the dam was PregSure-vaccinated (amOR 2.1; ci 1.1, 4.0; p = 0.024). Feeding exclusively dam's milk was a higher risk than other types of milk (amOR 3.4; ci 1.6, 7.5; p = 0.002). The population attributable fractions were 0.84 (ci 0.68, 0.92) for PregSure vaccination, 0.13 (ci 0.06, 0.19) for feeding other cows' colostrum, and 0.15 (ci 0.08, 0.22) for feeding dam's milk. No other calf-level factors were identified, suggesting that there are other important factors that are outside the scope of this study, such as genetics, which explain why BNP develops in some PregSure-colostrum-exposed calves but not in others.

{"text":"Background: Despite the crucial role of domestic dogs as reservoirs for zoonosis and some of the most threatening diseases for wild carnivores such as distemper and parvovirosis, little is known about the epidemiological features and the risk factors involved in pathogen exposure of dogs that live in human/wildlife interfaces and actually contacts wildlife. Through a cross-sectional serological approach and questionnaire survey, we assessed the prevalence along with individual and environment-associated risk factors for four important viral diseases of rural dogs living in households around six Atlantic Forest fragments in southeast Brazil. Results: Widespread exposure to canine parvovirus (97 %), canine distemper virus (15 %) and canine adenovirus (27 %) was detected, but none for canine coronavirus. Dogs from small private reserves were more exposed to parvovirus and canine distemper virus than those from larger state parks. Exposure was associated with dog sex and age, lack of health care and the number of people in the households. Remarkably, factors linked to free-ranging behaviour of dogs were associated with the exposure for all pathogens detected. Conclusions: According to identified associations, reducing viral pathogen exposure in dogs will require inhibiting dog's movements and access to nearby forests and villages and improving veterinary assistance. Promoting dog vaccination and population control through sterilization around protected areas is also necessary. The study provides support for preventive management actions aimed to protect the health of rural dogs, and consequently of Atlantic Forest's wild carnivores.","meta":{"paper_id":"eb856c32c1a41e6513729e126e84e639ce4f5a68","title":"Prevalence and risk factors for viral exposure in rural dogs around protected areas of the Atlantic forest","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-774222812,"_task_hash":1898904938,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":982,"end":985,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

We describe the clinical features and outcomes of patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data from all adult (>18 years old) patients admitted to our 20-bed mixed ICU with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection between October 1, 2012 and May 31, 2014. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on respiratory samples. Results: During the observation period, 31 patients were admitted with MERS-CoV infection (mean age 59 \u00b1 20 years, 22 [71 %] males).

{"text":"Background: An outbreak of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), comprising 185 cases linked to healthcare facilities, occurred in the Republic of Korea from May to July 2015. Owing to the nosocomial nature of the outbreak, it is particularly important to gain a better understanding of the epidemiological determinants characterizing the risk of MERS death in order to predict the heterogeneous risk of death in medical settings. We have devised a novel statistical model that identifies the risk of MERS death during the outbreak in real time. While accounting for the time delay from illness onset to death, risk factors for death were identified using a linear predictor tied to a logit model. We employ this approach to (1) quantify the risks of death and (2) characterize the temporal evolution of the case fatality ratio (CFR) as case ascertainment greatly improved during the course of the outbreak. Results: Senior persons aged 60 years or over were found to be 9.3 times (95 % confidence interval (CI), 5.3-16.9) more likely to die compared to younger MERS cases. Patients under treatment were at a 7.8-fold (95 % CI, 4.0-16.7) significantly higher risk of death compared to other MERS cases. The CFR among patients aged 60 years or older under treatment was estimated at 48.2 % (95 % CI, 35.2-61.3) as of July 31, 2015, while the CFR among other cases was estimated to lie below 15 %. From June 6, 2015, onwards, the CFR declined 0.3-fold (95 % CI, 0.1-1.1) compared to the earlier epidemic period, which may perhaps reflect enhanced case ascertainment following major contact tracing efforts. Conclusions: The risk of MERS death was significantly associated with older age as well as treatment for underlying diseases after explicitly adjusting for the delay between illness onset and death. Because MERS outbreaks are greatly amplified in the healthcare setting, enhanced infection control practices in medical facilities should strive to shield risk groups from MERS exposure.","meta":{"paper_id":"4bdb53b23deb0bc56d0aa7b26551ab76b1fd082e","title":"Real-time characterization of risks of death associated with the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in the Republic of Korea, 2015","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":1310860254,"_task_hash":-787949464,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1688,"end":1691,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R t ) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R t were examined using linear regression. R t usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1-1.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R t . We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R t (coefficients ranged from \u22120.14 to \u22120.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) causes a substantial disease burden in Asian regions including Hong Kong, mainly in children below 5 years of age 1-4 . Enterovirus 71 (EV71), coxsackievirus A16 (CA16) and coxsackievirus A6 (CA6) are the most common enterovirus serotypes causing HFMD in Hong Kong 2,5 . HFMD has a clear seasonal pattern in temperate regions with annual peaks in the summer 1,6 , while in tropical and subtropical regions including Hong Kong, multiple peaks may occur within a year 2,7 . Inconsistent findings about the associations between meteorological factors, such as temperature and relative humidity, and the incidence of HFMD were reported by different studies [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . HFMD is considered to be transmitted mainly through direct contact with contaminated discharges, fluid of blisters or stool from infected persons, or contaminated objects 16 . Attending kindergarten or child-care center and visiting public playground were also reported as risk factors for HFMD [17] [18] [19] . HFMD is highly transmissible, with a basic reproduction number (R 0 ) ranging from 2.5 to 5.5 for different serotypes in Hong Kong and Singapore 20,21 . A temperature of 21.1 to 26.7 \u00b0C, higher relative humidity and school period were reported to be associated with higher HFMD transmission in mainland China 22 . Other factors, such as host susceptibility and virus-specific transmissibility were also found to play vital roles in transmission of infectious diseases 23 . Currently, there is a lack of evidence about the potential risk factors and their impact on HFMD transmission. This study therefore aims to examine the transmissibility of HFMD and its potential driving factors in Hong Kong, where HFMD shows less obvious seasonality.","meta":{"paper_id":"7ba06e5c566af08208ee7d87cc8a0d6c2b772b9e","title":"Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-25891575,"_task_hash":-127465524,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1565,"end":1568,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Knowledge of risk factors for symptomatic human coronavirus (HCoV) infections in children in community settings is limited. We estimated the disease burden and impact of birth-related, maternal, household, and seasonal factors on HCoV infections among children from birth to 6 months old in rural Nepal. Methods. Prospective, active, weekly surveillance for acute respiratory infections (ARIs) was conducted in infants over a period of 3 years during 2 consecutive, population-based randomized trials of maternal influenza immunization. Midnasal swabs were collected for acute respiratory symptoms and tested for HCoV and other viruses by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Association between HCoV incidence and potential risk factors was modeled using Poisson regression. Results. Overall, 282 of 3505 (8%) infants experienced an HCoV ARI within the first 6 months of life. HCoV incidence overall was 255.6 (95% confidence interval [CI], 227.3-286.5) per 1000 person-years, and was more than twice as high among nonneonates than among neonates (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 2.53; 95% CI, 1.52-4.21). HCoV ARI incidence was also positively associated with the number of children <5 years of age per room in a household (IRR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01-1.28). Of the 296 HCoV infections detected, 46% were coinfections with other respiratory viruses. While HCoVs were detected throughout the study period, seasonal variation was also observed, with incidence peaking in 2 winters (December-February) and 1 autumn (September-November). Conclusions. HCoV is associated with a substantial proportion of illnesses among young infants in rural Nepal. There is an increased risk of HCoV infection beyond the first month of life.","meta":{"paper_id":"95648e7d8513a790e6e07df43a7ffac9bf882db5","title":"Clinical Infectious Diseases Burden and Risk Factors for Coronavirus Infections in Infants in Rural Nepal","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":839038398,"_task_hash":793419877,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1205,"end":1208,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

However, their characterization is incomplete because prevalence estimates are based on syndromic surveillance data. Here, we address this shortcoming through the analysis of infection rates among individuals tested regularly for respiratory viral infections, irrespective of their symptoms. We carried out longitudinal sampling and analysis among 214 individuals enrolled at multiple New York City locations from fall 2016 to spring 2018. We combined personal information with weekly nasal swab collection to investigate the prevalence of 18 respiratory viruses among different age groups and to assess risk factors associated with infection susceptibility. Results: 17.5% of samples were positive for respiratory viruses. Some viruses circulated predominantly during winter, whereas others were found year round. Rhinovirus and coronavirus were most frequently detected. Children registered the highest positivity rates, and adults with daily contacts with children experienced significantly more infections than their counterparts without children. : Respiratory viral infections are widespread among the general population with the majority of individuals presenting multiple infections per year.

{"text":"Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, coronary events, heart and renal failure, and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a major role in its pathogenesis.

{"text":"Background: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) including Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common infectious disease that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The patterns of aetiological pathogens differ by region and country. Special attention must be paid to CAP in Southeast Asia (SEA), a region facing rapid demographic transition. Estimates burden and aetiological patterns of CAP are essential for the clinical and public health management. The purposes of the study are to determine the incidence, aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the Vietnamese adult population. Methods: A prospective surveillance for hospitalised adult CAP was conducted in Khanh Hoa Province, Central Vietnam. All adults aged \u226515 years with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) admitted to a provincial hospital from September 2009 to August 2010 were enrolled in the study. Patients were classified into CAP and non-pneumonic LRTI (NPLRTI) according to the radiological findings. Bacterial pathogens were identified from sputum samples by the conventional culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis; 13 respiratory viruses were identified from nasopharyngeal specimens by PCR. Results: Of all 367 LRTI episodes examined, 174 (47%) were CAP. Older age, the presence of underlying respiratory conditions, and higher index score of smoking were associated with CAP. The one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised adult CAP in our study population was 0.81 per 1,000 person years. The incidence increased considerably with age and was highest among the elderly. The case fatality proportion of hospitalised CAP patients was 9.8%.

A concern was raised about the long term stability of the antibody responses.","meta":{"paper_id":"ee6d70a53e3262cea6f85bd8b226f6b4c8b5f64b","title":"Pandemic Influenza Due to pH1N1/2009 Virus: Estimation of Infection Burden in Reunion Island through a Prospective Serosurvey, Austral Winter 2009","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":148300501,"_task_hash":-440511774,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1299,"end":1302,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Background: To date, there is little information that reflects the true extent of spread of the pH1N1/2009v influenza pandemic at the community level as infection often results in mild or no clinical symptoms. This study aimed at assessing through a prospective study, the attack rate of pH1N1/2009 virus in Reunion Island and risk factors of infection, during the 2009 season. Methodology/Principal Findings: A serosurvey was conducted during the 2009 austral winter, in the frame of a prospective population study. Pairs of sera were collected from 1687 individuals belonging to 772 households, during and after passage of the pandemic wave. Antibodies to pH1N1/2009v were titered using the hemagglutination inhibition assay (HIA) with titers $1/40 being considered positive. Seroprevalence during the first two weeks of detection of pH1N1/2009v in Reunion Island was 29.8% in people under 20 years of age, 35.6% in adults (20-59 years) and 73.3% in the elderly ($60 years) (P,0.0001). Baseline corrected cumulative incidence rates, were 42.9%, 13.9% and 0% in these age groups respectively (P,0.0001). A significant decline in antibody titers occurred soon after the passage of the epidemic wave. Seroconversion rates to pH1N1/2009 correlated negatively with age: 63.2%, 39.4% and 16.7%, in each age group respectively (P,0.0001). Seroconversion occurred in 65.2% of individuals who were seronegative at inclusion compared to 6.8% in those who were initially seropositive. Conclusions: Seroincidence of pH1N1/2009v infection was three times that estimated from clinical surveillance, indicating that almost two thirds of infections occurring at the community level have escaped medical detection. People under 20 years of age were the most affected group. Pre-epidemic titers $1/40 prevented seroconversion and are likely protective against infection.

{"text":"Background: Age and breed are considered the greatest risk factors for disease prevalence and mortality in companion dogs. Understanding the prevalence of diseases, in relation to age and breed, would support appropriate guidance for future health care strategies and provide useful information for the early diagnosis of diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the major medical causes for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics in the Republic of Korea, stratified by age and breed. Methods: A total of 15,531 medical records of canine patients were analyzed from 11 veterinary clinics who shared data from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016. An electronic medical record (EMR) system was used for data collection, which included the animal identification number, age, breed, gender, neuter status, clinical information, and diagnosis. EMR data were classified using the International Classification of Disease system from the World Health Organization; presenting signs or diagnoses were identified according to breed and life stage. Results: Within the age groups, preventive medicine (16.7% confidence intervals (CI) [15.9-17.5]) was the most common cause for clinic visits for the <1 year and 1-3 year groups. Additionally, neutering surgery (6.6% CI [6.0-7.1]) and patella luxation (1.4% CI [1.8-2.7]) were frequently performed in these age groups. In the 4-6 year group, otitis externa (8.8% CI [7.8-10.0]) and dermatitis or eczema (8.5% CI [7.5-9.6]) were common medical problems. In older dogs (>10 year), the prevalences of heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing's disease, and mammary tumors were higher than in the other age groups. Small and toy breed dogs comprised 67.7% of all dogs in this analysis. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems. Discussion: This study identified the most common medical disorders and differences in prevalences of diseases, according to age and breeds.

Additionally, neutering surgery (6.6% CI [6.0-7.1]) and patella luxation (1.4% CI [1.8-2.7]) were frequently performed in these age groups. In the 4-6 year group, otitis externa (8.8% CI [7.8-10.0]) and dermatitis or eczema (8.5% CI [7.5-9.6]) were common medical problems. In older dogs (>10 year), the prevalences of heart disease, kidney disease, Cushing's disease, and mammary tumors were higher than in the other age groups. Small and toy breed dogs comprised 67.7% of all dogs in this analysis. For all breeds, otitis externa, dermatitis or eczema, vomiting, and diarrhea were common medical problems. Discussion: This study identified the most common medical disorders and differences in prevalences of diseases, according to age and breeds. The information from EMRs for dogs visiting primary-care veterinary clinics can provide background knowledge that is required to enable a better understanding of disease patterns and occurrence by age and breeds.

A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). Results: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.","meta":{"paper_id":"a78fd1b34372e1e54bf2a192d04aa36670cea307","title":"BMC Public Health Public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the Japanese general population: A population-based survey","score":0.5,"pattern":2},"_input_hash":1793128405,"_task_hash":223251164,"spans":[{"text":"smoking","start":633,"end":640,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-585476022,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"The cattle industry is one of the most important Brazilian agribusiness sectors and is a strong contributor to the national economy. Annually about 44.6 million calves are bred, which makes the optimal management of these animals extremely important. Several diseases can affect the initial stages of the bovine production chain, being the bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) one of the most relevant pathogens. This study aimed to characterize the epidemiology of BRSV infection in dairy cattle herds of S\u00e3o Paulo State, Brazil, using serological and risk factors analyses. For that, 1243 blood samples were collected of animals from 26 farms and a questionnaire about possible risk factors for BRSV prevalence was performed. The obtained blood sera were analyzed using virus neutralization test (VNT). Results: VNT results showed high BRSV prevalence in dairy cattle herds, reaching 79.5% of seropositivity. The BRSV seroprevalence among studied farms ranged from 40 to 100%. The analysis of risk factors indicated that the age group and the occurrence of coinfection with bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV-1) should be associated with a higher prevalence of BRSV, while natural suckling was considered a protective factor. The study showed that adult animals over 1 year old are an important risk factor for the high seroprevalence of BRSV in herds. The high BRSV prevalence associated with BoHV-1 and BVDV-1 suggests that biosecurity measures should be applied in order to reduce viral dissemination. Additionally, the natural suckling may be an important management to protect calves from high BRSV seroprevalence.","meta":{"paper_id":"923eca0b4175d09814a117b685e434c2f93bc25c","title":"Bovine respiratory syncytial virus seroprevalence and risk factors in non- vaccinated dairy cattle herds in Brazil","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":428736747,"_task_hash":683299884,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1032,"end":1035,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

{"text":"Bartonella spp. are globally distributed bacteria that cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals. Recent work has suggested bats as zoonotic reservoirs of some human Bartonella infections; however, the ecological and spatiotemporal patterns of infection in bats remain largely unknown. Here we studied the genetic diversity, prevalence of infection across seasons and years, individual risk factors, and possible transmission routes of Bartonella in populations of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) in Peru and Belize, for which high infection prevalence has previously been reported. Phylogenetic analysis of the gltA gene for a subset of PCR-positive blood samples revealed sequences that were related to Bartonella described from vampire bats from Mexico, other Neotropical bat species, and streblid bat flies. Sequences associated with vampire bats clustered significantly by country but commonly spanned Central and South America, implying limited spatial structure. Stable and nonzero Bartonella prevalence between years supported endemic transmission in all sites. The odds of Bartonella infection for individual bats was unrelated to the intensity of bat flies ectoparasitism, but nearly all infected bats were infested, which precluded conclusive assessment of support for vector-borne transmission. While metagenomic sequencing found no strong evidence of Bartonella DNA in pooled bat saliva and fecal samples, we detected PCR positivity in individual saliva and feces, suggesting the potential for bacterial transmission through both direct contact (i.e., biting) and environmental (i.e., fecal) exposures. Further investigating the relative contributions of direct contact, environmental, and vector-borne transmission for bat Bartonella is an important next step to predict infection dynamics within bats and the risks of human and livestock exposures. PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi. Bartonella are globally distributed bacteria that can cause endocarditis in humans and domestic animals. Bats have been implicated as a likely reservoir host for these bacteria, but little is known about how prevalence varies over time, routes of transmission, and the genetic diversity of Bartonella in bats. We present results from a two-year, spatially replicated study of common vampire bats, which have previously shown high infection prevalence of Bartonella and could pose risks of cross-species transmission due to their diet of mammal blood. We found that vampire bat Bartonella is genetically diverse, geographically widespread and endemic, and that individual-level infection risk is highest for large, male, non-reproductive bats. Phylogenetic analysis supported vector-borne transmission, and we found support for potential transmission through direct contact and fecal exposures through PCR. Confirming whether arthropod vectors are the main route of transmission for bat Bartonella is needed for understanding infection dynamics in bats and for predicting risks of cross-species transmission to humans and livestock.

{"text":"Background: Data from prospectively planned cohort studies on risk of major clinical outcomes and prognostic factors for patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus are limited. In 2009, in order to assess outcomes and evaluate risk factors for progression of illness, two cohort studies were initiated: FLU 002 in outpatients and FLU 003 in hospitalized patients. Methods and Findings: Between October 2009 and December 2012, adults with influenza-like illness (ILI) were enrolled; outpatients were followed for 14 days and inpatients for 60 days. Disease progression was defined as hospitalization and/or death for outpatients, and hospitalization for .28 days, transfer to intensive care unit (ICU) if enrolled from general ward, and/or death for inpatients. Infection was confirmed by RT-PCR. 590 FLU 002 and 392 FLU 003 patients with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 were enrolled from 81 sites in 17 countries at 2 days (IQR 1-3) and 6 days (IQR 4-10) following ILI onset, respectively. Disease progression was experienced by 29 (1 death) outpatients (5.1%; 95% CI: 3.4-7.2%) and 80 inpatients [death (32), hospitalization .28 days (43) or ICU transfer (20)] (21.6%; 95% CI: 17.5-26.2%). Disease progression (death) for hospitalized patients was 53.1% (26.6%) and 12.8% (3.8%), respectively, for those enrolled in the ICU and general ward. In pooled analyses for both studies, predictors of disease progression were age, longer duration of symptoms at enrollment and immunosuppression. Patients hospitalized during the pandemic period had a poorer prognosis than in subsequent seasons. Conclusions: Patients with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, particularly when requiring hospital admission, are at high risk for disease progression, especially if they are older, immunodeficient, or admitted late in infection. These data reinforce the need for international trials of novel treatment strategies for influenza infection and serve as a reminder of the need to monitor the severity of seasonal and pandemic influenza epidemics globally.","meta":{"paper_id":"0542a6ae26f57a5ffa35dcfebdec5004ff45688c","title":"Outcomes of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus Infection: Results from Two International Cohort Studies","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":734604556,"_task_hash":724986174,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1412,"end":1415,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Here we found that RTD-1 was rapidly fungicidal against blastospores of fluconazole/caspofungin resistant C. albicans strains, and was active against established C. albicans biofilms in vitro. In vivo, systemic administration of RTD-1, initiated at the time of infection or 24 h post-infection, promoted long term survival in candidemic mice whether infected with drug-sensitive or MDR strains of C. albicans. RTD-1 induced an early (4 h post treatment) increase in neutrophils in naive and infected mice. In vivo efficacy was associated with fungal clearance, restoration of dysregulated inflammatory cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-17, and homeostatic reduction in numbers of circulating neutrophils and monocytes. Because these effects occurred using peptide doses that produced maximal plasma concentrations (Cmax) of less than 1% of RTD-1 levels required for in vitro antifungal activity in 50% mouse serum, while inducing a transient neutrophilia, we suggest that RTD-1 mediates its antifungal effects in vivo by host directed mechanisms rather than direct fungicidal activity. Results of this study suggest that \u03b8-defensins represent a new class of host-directed compounds for treatment of disseminated candidiasis. Systemic infection caused by MDR fungi is a growing global health concern. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million cases of disseminated mycoses occur annually and are associated with high mortality rates 1-3 . Fungal pathogens are a major cause of hospital-acquired infection 4 , particularly among surgical patients and those with indwelling catheters 5 . Increased risk of systemic fungal infection is also associated with biologic therapies for treatment of inflammatory or autoimmune diseases 6,7 . Among fungal infections, Candida spp. are the most frequent causative organisms worldwide 4,8 . Over 400,000 cases of candidiasis occur annually 9 with increased risk of infection associated with defects in innate immunity, neutropenia, and diabetes 10-12 . The growing incidence of MDR Candida spp. infections has contributed to the increase in mortality rates associated with systemic candidiasis 13-15 . A major risk factor for systemic candidiasis is the presence of biofilms that commonly colonize implanted medical devices such as venous catheters. Biofilms are notoriously resistant to antifungal therapy and are the source of blood borne dissemination [16] [17] [18] [19] . The failure to develop agents that are selective against eukaryotic pathogens has impeded the clinical introduction of new antifungals 14 . Currently, there are but three classes of antifungal drugs that are relied upon for treatment of invasive fungal infections: polyenes, azoles, and echinocandins 20 . Echinocandins, introduced nearly 20 years ago, are the most recently approved class of antifungals. Limitations associated with use of currently available agents include limited activity spectra 17,21,22 , serious adverse side effects 23,24 , and lack of activity against biofilms 25, 26 . The emergence of MDR fungal pathogens underscores the urgent need for development of new approaches for treatment of fungal infections [27] [28] [29] . \u03b8-defensins are macrocyclic peptides containing an 18 amino acid cyclic backbone stabilized by a tri-disulfide core 30 . Numerous naturally occurring \u03b8-defensin isoforms are expressed in Old World monkeys (OWM) such as macaques, baboons, and vervets 31-34 , but the peptides are absent in New World monkeys, apes and humans 30 . RTD-1, the prototype rhesus macaque \u03b8-defensin, is effective in preclinical models of polymicrobial and E. coli sepsis 35 , SARS-coronavirus infection 36 , a mouse model of P. aeruginosa induced cystic fibrosis 37 , and endotoxin-induced lung injury 38 . In a recent study we reported that \u03b8-defensins are potently fungicidal in vitro against MDR C. albicans and non-albicans Candida spp., including the emerging pathogen Candida auris 39 . In the current study we evaluated the antifungal activities of RTD-1 against planktonic cells and biofilms of drug sensitive and MDR C. albicans strains in vitro, and found the peptide to be fungicidal against both forms of each strain. We then tested RTD-1 for efficacy in a therapeutic mouse model of systemic candidiasis and analyzed the effects of peptide treatment on survival, fungal clearance, and on inflammatory biomarkers in infections mediated by drug-sensitive and MDR isolates of C. albicans. (Drew Scientific). Plasma cytokine levels plasma were quantified using a mouse-specific MILLIPLEX MAP kit (Millipore) as described 35 . Statistical analyses. Survival curves were compared using the log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Blood levels of PMNs and monocytes, and plasma levels of cytokines were compared using Mann-Whitney test.

{"text":"Respiratory diseases are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in many tropical countries, including Lao PDR. However, little has been published regarding viral or bacterial pathogens that can contribute to influenza-like illness (ILI) in a community setting. We report on the results of a community-based surveillance that prospectively monitored the incidence of ILI and its causative pathogens in Vientiane capital in Lao PDR. A cohort of 995 households, including 4885 study participants, were followed-up between May 2015 and May 2016. Nasopharyngeal swabs, throat swabs, and sputum specimens were collected from ILI cases identified through active case-finding. Real-Time PCR was used to test nasopharyngeal swabs for 21 respiratory pathogens, while throat and sputum samples were subjected to bacterial culture. Generalized linear mixed models were used to assess potential risk factors for associations with ILI. In total, 548 episodes of ILI were reported among 476 (9.7%) of the study participants and 330 (33.2%) of the study households. The adjusted estimated incidence of ILI within the study area was 10.7 (95%CI: 9.4-11.9) episodes per 100 personyears. ILI was significantly associated with age group (p<0.001), sex (p<0.001), and number of bedrooms (p = 0.04) in multivariate analysis. In 548 nasopharyngeal swabs, the most commonly detected potential pathogens were Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.3%), influenza A (11.1%; mostly subtype H3N2), rhinovirus (7.5%), and influenza B (8.0%). Streptococci were isolated from 42 (8.6%) of 536 throat swabs, most (27) of which were Lancefield Group G. Co-infections were observed in 132 (24.1%) of the 548 ILI episodes. Our study generated valuable data on respiratory disease burden and patterns of etiologies associated with community-acquired acute respiratory illness Laos.","meta":{"paper_id":"d18a705998ad871dad46aeabeeed0a20909c10df","title":"\"Epidemiology and aetiology of influenza-like illness among households in metropolitan Vientiane, Lao PDR\": A prospective, community-based cohort study","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-699503672,"_task_hash":1117335147,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1215,"end":1218,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"In 2009, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) was identified as a novel member of the genus phlebovirus in the Bunyaviridae family in China. The detailed clinical features of cases with SFTSV infection have not been well described, and the risk factors for severity among patients and fatality among severe patients remain to be determined. Clinical and laboratory features of 115 hospitalized patients with SFTSV infection during the period from June 2010 to December 2011 in Northeast China were retrospectively reviewed. We assessed the risk factors associated with severity in confirmed cases and fatality in severe cases by multivariate analysis. One hundred and three (89.6%) of 115 patients presented with multiple organ dysfunction, and 22 (19.1%) of 115 proceeded to the stage of life threatening multiple organ failure. Of the 115 patients, 14 fatalities (12.2%) were reported. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the independent predictors of risk for severity were: albumin \u226430 g/l (OR, 8.09; 95% CI, 2.58-25.32), APTT \u2265 66 seconds (OR, 14.28; 95% CI, 3.28-62.24), sodium \u2264130 mmol/l (OR, 5.44; 95% CI, 1.38-21.40), and presence of neurological manifestations (OR, 7.70; 95% CI, 1.91-31.12). Among patients with severe disease, presence of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR, 4.59; 95% CI, 1. 48-14.19) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (HR, 4.24; 95% CI, 1.38-13.03) were independently associated with fatality. Conclusions/Significance: SFTSV infection may present with more severe symptoms and laboratory abnormalities than hitherto reported. Due to infection with a novel bunyavirus, the patients may sufferer multiple organ dysfunction and die of multiple organ failure. In the clinical assessment of any case of SFTS, independent factors relating to prognosis need to be taken into account by clinicians.","meta":{"paper_id":"00fcc6277c19f6b180232d7a6fe0b0abfafb21f7","title":"Clinical Features and Factors Associated with Severity and Fatality among Patients with Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Bunyavirus Infection in Northeast China","score":0.5,"pattern":9},"_input_hash":-1075955444,"_task_hash":1585529575,"spans":[{"text":"thrombocytopenia","start":27,"end":43,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-189663941,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

We sought to identify risk factors and characterize enteropathogens from diarrheic stools of HIV-positive patients in Gondar, Ethiopia using multiplex molecular panels targeting key infectious agents. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 100 stool samples was performed. Samples were collected consecutively from HIV-positive patients presenting with diarrhea at University of Gondar Hospital clinic, a major center in NW Ethiopia. Genomic DNA was extracted from stool and processed using a multiplex molecular panel Allplex\u2122 [Seegene, Canada]. Correlations between patient characteristics, symptoms, public health risk factors, and enteropathogen type (s) were studied. Eighty-six samples were successfully analyzed by molecular methods. Results: The mean age was 35 with 43% male. Eighty percent lived in an urban area, 18% had access to well water only, and 81% practiced proper hand hygiene.

Viral infection occurred in 32.6% (148/454) with influenza (40/454; 8.8%) most common. Bacterial-viral coinfection occurred in 9.1% (28/307). Detection of M. tuberculosis was associated with mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 2.44 [1.19-5.01]). Conclusions: In the antiretroviral therapy era, CAP in Malawi remains predominantly HIV associated, with a large proportion attributable to potentially vaccine-preventable pathogens. Strategies to increase early detection and treatment of tuberculosis and improve supportive care, in particular the correction of hypoxemia, should be evaluated in clinical trials to address CAPassociated mortality.","meta":{"paper_id":"045b111f0f2584890e9271399aa93c917a496662","title":"Etiology and Risk Factors for Mortality in an Adult Community-acquired Pneumonia Cohort in Malawi","score":0.5,"pattern":1},"_input_hash":167020820,"_task_hash":-1628005083,"spans":[{"text":"male","start":844,"end":848,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1182060400,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Since our Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD 2010), the region has faced unrest as a result of revolutions, wars, and the so-called Arab uprisings. The objective of this study was to present the burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors in the eastern Mediterranean region as of 2013. Methods-GBD 2013 includes an annual assessment covering 188 countries from 1990 to 2013. The study covers 306 diseases and injuries, 1233 sequelae, and 79 risk factors. Our GBD 2013 analyses included the addition of new data through updated systematic reviews and through the contribution of unpublished data sources from collaborators, an updated version of modelling software, and several improvements in our methods. In this systematic analysis, we use data from GBD 2013 to analyse the burden of disease and injuries in the eastern Mediterranean region specifically. Findings-The leading cause of death in the region in 2013 was ischaemic heart disease (90\u00b73 deaths per 100 000 people), which increased by 17\u00b72% since 1990. However, diarrhoeal diseases were the leading cause of death in Somalia (186\u00b77 deaths per 100 000 people) in 2013, which decreased by 26\u00b79% since 1990. The leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) was ischaemic heart disease for males and lower respiratory infection for females. High blood pressure was the leading risk factor for DALYs in 2013, with an increase of 83\u00b73% since 1990. Risk factors for DALYs varied by country. In low-income countries, childhood wasting was the leading cause of DALYs in Afghanistan, Somalia, and Yemen, whereas unsafe sex was the leading cause in Djibouti. Non-communicable risk factors were the leading cause of DALYs in high-income and middle-income countries in the region. DALY risk factors varied by age, with child and maternal malnutrition affecting the younger age groups (aged 28 days to 4 years), whereas high bodyweight This is an Open Access article under the CC BY license. and systolic blood pressure affected older people (aged 60-80 years). The proportion of DALYs attributed to high body-mass index increased from 3\u00b77% to 7\u00b75% between 1990 and 2013. Burden of mental health problems and drug use increased. Most increases in DALYs, especially from noncommunicable diseases, were due to population growth. The crises in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and Syria have resulted in a reduction in life expectancy; life expectancy in Syria would have been 5 years higher than that recorded for females and 6 years higher for males had the crisis not occurred. Interpretation-Our study shows that the eastern Mediterranean region is going through a crucial health phase. The Arab uprisings and the wars that followed, coupled with ageing and population growth, will have a major impact on the region's health and resources. The region has historically seen improvements in life expectancy and other health indicators, even under stress. However, the current situation will cause deteriorating health conditions for many countries and for many years and will have an impact on the region and the rest of the world. Based on our findings, we call for increased investment in health in the region in addition to reducing the conflicts.","meta":{"paper_id":"b6f1dc149af87fc1daff699b8b599dae61773ebd","title":"Lancet Glob Health","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-400326019,"_task_hash":-1976781197,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1815,"end":1818,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

{"text":"Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be fatal if untreated early and appropriately. Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 levels and lesion size and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1\u03b2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd 1 year were significantly low by an average of 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's duration of \ufffd 5years (reference group). Furthermore, the risk factors of higher levels of IL-35 in mycetoma patients revealed a negative significant association with IL-12, PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0007098 April 4, 2019 1 / 18 OPEN ACCESS Citation: Abushouk A, Nasr A, Masuadi E, Allam G, Siddig EE, Fahal AH (2019) The Role of Interleukin-1 cytokine family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and interleukin-12 cytokine family (IL-12, IL-35) in eumycetoma infection pathogenesis. PLoS Negl Trop Dis 13(4): e0007098. https://doi.org/10.as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd one year were significantly low on average by 41.82 pg/ml (p value = 0.002) compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd 5 years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 in eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact on disease progression. Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community. Previous data suggested a crucial role of adaptive immunity in host resistance to causative agents and in the disease progress. The recently identified IL-35 and IL-37 cytokines revealed an important role in immune suppression. Nevertheless, the expression of these interleukins in patients with mycetoma has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present case-control study aimed to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The results of this study showed that, the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration.

{"text":"Mycetoma is a neglected tropical disease, endemic in many tropical and subtropical regions, characterised by massive deformity and disability and can be fatal if untreated early and appropriately. Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma has not yet been explored. The aim of this study is to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). There was a significant negative correlation between IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 levels and lesion size and disease duration, while IL-37 and IL-35 levels were significantly positively correlated with both lesion size and disease duration. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of mycetoma showed a negative significant association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine, where a unit increment in IL-1\u03b2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ ml. The levels of IL-37 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd 1 year were significantly low by an average of 18.45 pg/ml compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's duration of \ufffd 5years (reference group).

PLoS Negl Trop Dis 13(4): e0007098. https://doi.org/10.as a unit increment in IL-12 decreases the levels of IL-35 by 8.99 pg/ml (p < 0.001). Levels of IL-35 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd one year were significantly low on average by 41.82 pg/ml (p value = 0.002) compared to patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \ufffd 5 years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 in eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative impact on disease progression. Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community. Previous data suggested a crucial role of adaptive immunity in host resistance to causative agents and in the disease progress. The recently identified IL-35 and IL-37 cytokines revealed an important role in immune suppression. Nevertheless, the expression of these interleukins in patients with mycetoma has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the present case-control study aimed to determine the levels of IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in these patients and the association between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The results of this study showed that, the levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were consistently positively correlated with different diameters of mycetoma lesions as well as its duration. However, the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 were consistently negatively correlated with different diameters of lesions and the duration of mycetoma infection.

{"text":"Background: Since Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) infection was first reported in 2012, many studies have analysed its transmissibility and severity. However, the methodology and results of these studies have varied, and there has been no systematic review of MERS. This study reviews the characteristics and associated risk factors of MERS. Method: We searched international (PubMed, ScienceDirect, Cochrane) and Korean databases (DBpia, KISS) for English-or Korean-language articles using the terms \"MERS\" and \"Middle East respiratory syndrome\". Only human studies with > 20 participants were analysed to exclude studies with low representation. Epidemiologic studies with information on transmissibility and severity of MERS as well as studies containing MERS risk factors were included. Result: A total of 59 studies were included. Most studies from Saudi Arabia reported higher mortality (22-69.2%) than those from South Korea (20.4%). While the R 0 value in Saudi Arabia was < 1 in all but one study, in South Korea, the R 0 value was 2.5-8.09 in the early stage and decreased to < 1 in the later stage. The incubation period was 4.5-5.2 days in Saudi Arabia and 6-7.8 days in South Korea. Duration from onset was 4-10 days to confirmation, 2.9-5.3 days to hospitalization, 11-17 days to death, and 14-20 days to discharge. Older age and concomitant disease were the most common factors related to MERS infection, severity, and mortality. Conclusion: The transmissibility and severity of MERS differed by outbreak region and patient characteristics. Further studies assessing the risk of MERS should consider these factors.","meta":{"paper_id":"e29425dbc37811e314513aed5880fbd088f52971","title":"MERS transmission and risk factors: a systematic review","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-700586549,"_task_hash":899262034,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1344,"end":1347,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

{"text":"Background: Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is characterized by interstitial infiltration of T lymphocytes, and subpopulations of these cells may be associated with the progression of fibrosis. However, few studies evaluate the correlation of prognosis with this characteristic. Therefore, we performed morphological and quantitative analyses of T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP and evaluated the relationship between T lymphocytes and prognosis. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in 55 biopsies of patients with NSIP to determine the numbers of these T cell subpopulations in lymphoid follicles as well as in perivascular, interstitial, and peribronchial anatomical compartments. The relationship between CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocyte populations and prognosis was analyzed. Results: The mean age of 55 patients was 48.9 \u00b1 10.5 years, and 36 (65 %) of patients were women. All patients were followed for a mean duration of 46 \u00b1 25 months. Thirteen (23.6 %) patients died during follow-up. Perivascular CD4+ lymphocyte infiltration (HR, 0.939; 95 % CI, 0.883-0.999; p = 0.048) was an independent risk factor for survival. Perivascular infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes correlated with survival time (r = 0.270, p = 0.046). Patients with improved forced vital capacity survived longer and had higher numbers of CD4+ T lymphocytes that infiltrated perivascular tissue. The densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes infiltrating other tissues were not significantly associated with survival time. Conclusions: Perivascular infiltration of CD4+ T lymphocytes in patients with NSIP correlated with prognosis.

Methods: A retrospective study was performed among 758 'frontline' health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the \"case group\" and the \"control group\", and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs. After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which an individual worked, the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that incidence of SARS among HCWs was significantly and positively associated with: performing tracheal intubations for SARS patients, methods used for air ventilation in wards, avoiding face-to-face interaction with SARS patients, the number of pairs of gloves worn by HCWs, and caring for serious SARS cases. Conclusion: Some measures, particularly good air ventilation in SARS wards, may be effective in minimizing or preventing SARS transmission among HCWs in hospitals.","meta":{"paper_id":"58ebd3ddb3543355def684c9762e4e24388c61bb","title":"BMC Public Health Which preventive measures might protect health care workers from SARS?","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":696745547,"_task_hash":-2137233718,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":803,"end":806,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Background: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major cause of pediatric morbidity and mortality, especially among non-affluent communities. In this study we determine the impact of respiratory viruses and how viral co-detections/infections can affect clinical LRTI severity in children in a hospital setting. Methods: Patients younger than 3 years of age admitted to a tertiary hospital in Brazil during the months of high prevalence of respiratory viruses had samples collected from nasopharyngeal aspiration. These samples were tested for 13 different respiratory viruses through real-time PCR (rt-PCR). Patients were followed during hospitalization, and clinical data and population characteristics were collected during that period and at discharge to evaluate severity markers, especially length of hospital stay and oxygen use. Univariate regression analyses identified potential risk factors and multivariate logistic regressions were used to determine the impact of specific viral detections as well as viral co-detections in relation to clinical outcomes. We analyzed 260 episodes of LRTI with a viral detection rate of 85% (n = 222). Co-detection was observed in 65% of all virus-positive episodes. The most prevalent virus was Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (54%), followed by Human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) (32%) and Human Rhinovirus (HRV) (21%). In the multivariate models, infants with co-detection of HRV + RSV stayed 4.5 extra days (p = 0.004), when compared to infants without the codetection. The same trends were observed for the outcome of days of supplemental oxygen use. Conclusions: Although RSV remains as the main cause of LRTI in infants our study indicates an increase in the length of hospital stay and oxygen use in infants with HRV detected by RT-PCR compared to those without HRV. Moreover, one can speculate that when HRV is detected simultaneously with RSV there is an additive effect that may be reflected in more severe clinical outcome. Also, our study identified a significant number of children infected by recently identified viruses, such as hMPV and Human Bocavirus (HBov), and this is a novel finding for poor communities from developing countries.","meta":{"paper_id":"1b8bd44173742cd254617aabc5fdf20fb98f4072","title":"Severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and toddlers from a non-affluent population: viral etiology and co-detection as risk factors","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-1668392547,"_task_hash":1153353292,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":362,"end":365,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

Methods: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect Mycoplasma haemofelis (Mhf), \"Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum\" (CMhm) and \"Candidatus Mycoplasma turicensis\" (CMt) in blood samples from 456 client-owned and 138 stray cats from Madrid. In order to assess associations between these hemoplasma infections and epidemiological parameters, data regarding signalment, environment, prophylaxis measures, retrovirus status, clinical signs and laboratory findings were compiled, whenever possible. Results: DNA of feline hemoplasmas was detected from the blood of 63 out of 594 cats (10.6%), with a prevalence of 3.7% (22/594) for Mhf, 8.1% (48/594) for CMhm and 0.5% (3/594) for CMt. Stray cats had statistically higher prevalences of feline hemoplasmas (15.9%) and, specifically, of Mhf (8.7%) than client-owned cats (9 and 2.2%, respectively). A total of seven cats (1.17%) were co-infected with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and M. haemofelis, two (0.33%) with \"Candidatus M. haemominutum\" and \"Candidatus M. turicensis\" and another one (0. 17%) with M. haemofelis and Candidatus \"M. turicensis\". Male gender, collection of blood during warm months and FeLV/FIV positivity status were associated with hemotropic mycoplasma infection in cats from Madrid. Additionally, within the group of client-owned cats, hemoplasma infection was associated with adult age, outdoor access, and the existence of low haematocrit, erythrocyte count and haemoglobin concentration values. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiological survey of feline hemoplasmas performed in central Spain (Madrid). Our study confirms that \"Ca. Mycoplasma haemominutum\", Mycoplasma haemofelis and \"Ca. Mycoplasma turicensis\" are infecting client-owned and stray cats in this region of Spain, \"Ca.

{"text":"The sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) encoded by SLC10A1 was recently demonstrated to be a functional receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV). The role of SLC10A1 polymorphisms, particularly the Ser267Phe variant (rs2296651) in exon 4, has been frequently investigated in regard to risk of persistent HBV infection. However, these investigations have generated conflicting results. To examine whether common genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is associated with risk of persistent HBV infection, haplotype-tagging and imputed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were assessed in two case-control sample sets, totally including 2,550 cases (persistently HBV infected subjects, PIs) and 2,124 controls (spontaneously recovered subjects, SRs) of Southern Chinese ancestry. To test whether rare or subpolymorphic SLC10A1 variants are associated with disease risk, the gene's exons in 244 cases were sequenced. Overall, we found neither SNPs nor haplotypes of SLC10A1 showed significant association in the two sample sets. Furthermore, no significant associations of rare variants or copy number variation covering SLC10A1 were observed. Finally, expression quantitative trait locus analyses revealed that SNPs potentially affecting SLC10A1 expression also showed no significant associations. We conclude that genetic variation at the SLC10A1 locus is not likely a major risk factor of persistent HBV infection among Southern Chinese. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major infectious disease with more than 250 million chronic carriers worldwide, with potential to cause chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and death 1 .

We prospectively enrolled hospitalized children aged <16 years with LRTI from 2006 to 2015. Children were clinically examined, and nasopharyngeal aspirates were analyzed using semi-quantitative, real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for HMPV, RSV and 17 other pathogens. HMPV-positive samples were genotyped. A total of 171 children had HMPV infection. HMPV-infected children with single virus (n = 106) and co-detections (n = 65) had similar clinical manifestations.

HMPV is usually detected in airway secretions from children with RTI by use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, and the virus seldom appears in healthy children [8] . HMPV has been classified into the Pneumoviridae family. Two main genotypes (A and B) and at least four genetic subtypes (A1, A2, B1 and B2) exist [9-12]. Whether these genotypes cause similar or different infections is largely unclarified because some studies have shown quite similar manifestations [13] [14] [15] , whereas others found that either genotypes A [16, 17] or B [18] may cause more severe disease. Using sensitive nucleic-acid based molecular tests to diagnose viral pathogens has revealed that many children with LRTI have more than one virus present in the respiratory tract [14, 19, 20] . Previous studies in HMPV-infected children found that such viral co-detections were associated with increased disease severity [21, 22] . However, this was not confirmed in other studies [14, 17, 19, 23] . HMPV is closely related to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), by far the most important airway virus affecting children worldwide [6, 14, 20, 24] .

{"text":"Background: We aimed to investigate the effects of ambient respiratory viral infections in the general population on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) development. Methods: Data of weekly incident RA (2012RA ( -2013 were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance claims database, and those of weekly observations on eight respiratory viral infections were obtained from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention database. We estimated the percentage change in incident RA associated with ambient mean respiratory viral infections using a generalized linear model, after adjusting for time trend, air pollution, and meteorological data. Results: A total of 24,117 cases of incident RA (mean age 54.7 years, 18,688 [77.5%] women) were analyzed. Ambient respiratory viral infections in the population were associated with a higher number of incident RA over time, and its effect peaked 6 or 7 weeks after exposure. Among the 8 viruses, parainfluenza virus (4.8% for 1% respiratory viral infection increase, 95% CI 1.6 to 8.1, P = .003), coronavirus (9.2%, 3.9 to 14.8, P < .001), and metapneumovirus (44%, 2.0 to 103.4, P = .038) were associated with increased number of incident RA.

{"text":"Evidence suggests that reduced intake of fruit and vegetables may play a critical role in the development of asthma and allergies. The present review aimed to summarize the evidence for the association between fruit and vegetable intake, risk of asthma/wheeze and immune responses. Databases including PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE were searched up to June 2016. Studies that investigated the effects of fruit and vegetable intake on risk of asthma/wheeze and immune responses were considered eligible (n = 58). Studies used cross-sectional (n = 30), cohort (n = 13), case-control (n = 8) and experimental (n = 7) designs. Most of the studies (n = 30) reported beneficial associations of fruit and vegetable consumption with risk of asthma and/or respiratory function, while eight studies found no significant relationship. Some studies (n = 20) reported mixed results, as they found a negative association between fruit only or vegetable only, and asthma. In addition, the meta-analyses in both adults and children showed inverse associations between fruit intake and risk of prevalent wheeze and asthma severity (p < 0.05). Likewise, vegetable intake was negatively associated with risk of prevalent asthma (p < 0.05). Seven studies examined immune responses in relation to fruit and vegetable intake in asthma, with n = 6 showing a protective effect against either systemic or airway inflammation. Fruit and vegetable consumption appears to be protective against asthma. Nutrients 2017, 9, 341 2 of 26 asthma exacerbations [4, 5] . The considerable morbidity related to asthma may be ameliorated by addressing modifiable risk factors such as diet [6] . It has been suggested that the increased prevalence of asthma in recent decades may be associated with changes in dietary habits since the 1950s-particularly, deficiency in dietary antioxidants [7] . The Western diet has shifted towards less fruit and vegetables, and high intakes of convenience foods that are low in fibre and antioxidants and rich in saturated fats [8, 9] . Oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathophysiology of asthma, due to chronic activation of airway inflammatory cells [10] . There is ample evidence that oxidative stress can have various deleterious effects on airway function, including airway smooth muscle contraction, induction of BHR, mucus hypersecretion, epithelial shedding and vascular exudation [11, 12] . Moreover, reactive oxygen species (ROS) can activate transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), which results in a cascade of events involving upregulation of the transcription of various inflammatory cytokine genes, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and eventually influx and degranulation of airway neutrophils [8] . Fresh fruit and vegetables provide rich sources of antioxidants and other biologically active substances (such as flavonoids, isoflavonoids and polyphenolic compounds) [12] . Studies have shown that diets with low average consumption of fruit and vegetables play a major role in the development of allergic diseases [1, 7] , and may augment oxidative stress in asthma [13] . Antioxidants can reduce airway inflammation via protecting the airways against oxidants by both endogenous (activated inflammatory cells) and exogenous (such as air pollution, cigarette smoke) sources [7] . Moreover, dietary antioxidants present in fruit and vegetables can scavenge ROS, and thus inhibit NF\u03baB-mediated inflammation, while diets low in antioxidants have reduced capacity to respond to oxidative stress [8] . Currently available asthma medications, such as glucocorticoids, are ineffective in some cases such as viral-induced exacerbations [14] ; and prolonged treatment with these therapeutic agents can result in adverse effects, such as pneumonia, cataracts, and osteoporosis [15] . Therefore, non-pharmacological interventions are required to reduce the burden of asthma in both adults and children. Understanding the roles of dietary nutrients in asthma and asthma-related complications may help in the management of this chronic inflammatory disease. Hence, a systematic review of the intake of fruits and vegetables and their effects on immune responses and asthma risk is of interest. This paper aimed to describe studies investigating the effects of fruit and vegetable consumption on risk of asthma and wheezing and immune responses (including immune responses to virus infection and inflammation) in asthma and wheezing. Methods PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE databases were included in the literature search, which was conducted in June 2016, including all previously published articles. Studies were limited to humans with no language restrictions. Additional studies were identified by hand searching references from the identified studies. See Figure 1 for an example of the search strategy. Only original studies with the following designs were included: randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, case-control studies, before and after studies, and cross sectional studies. Case studies, case reports, animal studies, opinion papers, in vitro studies and conference abstracts were excluded. Review articles were collected for the purposes of reviewing the reference list and did not contribute to the final number of included studies. The target study population was human of all age, gender or ethnicity, with asthma, wheeze, airway inflammation or other related respiratory symptoms. The exposure of interest was intake of whole or extracted fruit and vegetables.

{"text":"Background: Viral respiratory infection (VRI) is a common contraindication to elective surgery. Asymptomatic shedding among pediatric surgery patients (PSPs) could potentially lead to progression of symptomatic diseases and cause outbreaks of respiratory diseases. The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of infection among mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group after surgical procedure. Methods: We collected the induced sputum from enrolled 1629 children (under 18 years of age) with no respiratory symptom prior to pediatric surgery between March 2017 and February 2019. We tested 16 different respiratory virus infections in post-surgery mild symptomatic PSP group and asymptomatic PSP group using a quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assay panel. We analyzed symptom data and quantitative viral load to investigate the association between viruses, symptoms and viral quantity in qRT-PCR-positive PSPs. Results: Out of 1629 children enrolled, a total of 204 respiratory viruses were present in 171 (10.50%) PSPs including 47 patients with mild symptoms and 124 with no symptoms after surgery. Commonly detected viruses were human rhino/enterovirus (HRV/EV, 42.19%), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3, 24.48%), coronavirus (CoV NL63, OC43, HKU1, 11.46%), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 9.9%). PIV3 infection with a higher viral load was frequently found in PSPs presenting with mild symptoms, progressing to pneumonia with radiographic evidence after surgery. HRV/EV were the most commonly detected pathogens in both asymptomatic and mild symptomatic PSPs. CoV (OC43, HKU1) infections with a higher viral load were mostly observed in asymptomatic PSPs progressing to alveolar or interstitial infiltration. Conclusions: Our study suggested that PIV3 is a new risk factor for VRI in PSPs. Employing a more comprehensive, sensitive and quantitative method should be considered for preoperative testing of respiratory viruses in order to guide optimal surgical timing.","meta":{"paper_id":"f849d3e71f4d2eae8a1e39802195bc9c06fc30ae","title":"Respiratory virus associated with surgery in children patients","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-1646564384,"_task_hash":2039689145,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":506,"end":509,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

{"text":"To estimate the proportion of healthcare workers (HCWs) willing to work during an influenza pandemic and identify associated risk factors, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis compliant with PRISMA guidance. Databases and grey literature were searched to April 2013, and records were screened against protocol eligibility criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were undertaken using a piloted form. Random-effects meta-analyses estimated (i) pooled proportion of HCWs willing to work and (ii) pooled odds ratios of risk factors associated with willingness to work. Heterogeneity was quantified using the I 2 statistic, and publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and Egger's test. Data were synthesized narratively where meta-analyses were not possible. Forty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of the proportion of HCWs willing to work was abandoned due to excessive heterogeneity (I 2 = 99\u00c12%). Narrative synthesis showed study estimates ranged from 23\u00c11% to 95\u00c18% willingness to work, depending on context. Meta-analyses of specific factors showed that male HCWs, physicians and nurses, full-time employment, perceived personal safety, awareness of pandemic risk and clinical knowledge of influenza pandemics, role-specific knowledge, pandemic response training, and confidence in personal skills were statistically significantly associated with increased willingness. Childcare obligations were significantly associated with decreased willingness. HCWs' willingness to work during an influenza pandemic was moderately high, albeit highly variable. Numerous risk factors showed a statistically significant association with willingness to work despite significant heterogeneity between studies.

{"text":"Overuse of emergency rooms (ER) is a public health problem. To investigate this issue, a cross-sectional survey was conducted at the ERs of King Abdul-Aziz Hospital, King Fahd Hospital, and Al-Thaghor Hospital in November 2013 with the aims of estimating emergency service utilization for non-urgent cases, identifying the predictors of ER utilization for non-urgent cases, and measuring patients' knowledge of primary healthcare centers (PHCCs). Patients were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and the data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. We recruited 300 patients; males comprised 50.7% of the sample. A higher proportion of patients with non-urgent cases visited the ER three to four times a year (P=0.001). A higher proportion of patients without emergencies had not attempted to visit an outpatient clinic before the ER (P=0.003). Most patients without emergencies thought the ER was the first place to consult in case of illness. Most patients who visited the ER were single, < 15 years, and had lower incomes. Patients requested ER services for primary care-treatable conditions because of limited services and resources as well as limited working hours at PHCCs. Most patients (90.0%) were knowledgeable about PHCCs, with those of lower education being more knowledgeable. Patients reported long ER waiting times (\u2265 3 hours), no organization (85.9%), and lack of medical staff. Overall, overuse of ER services is high at the Ministry of Health hospitals in Jeddah. The risk factors for ER overuse are age < 15 years, singlehood, and low incomes. Policy makers and health providers have a challenging task to control ER overuse. We recommend developing strategies to implement policies aimed at reducing non-urgent ER use as well as making healthcare services more available to the population.","meta":{"paper_id":"b562f1a519bc6a12df5e62930bdf4345cf0f7ce9","title":"Utilization of the Emergency Department and Predicting Factors Associated With Its Use at the Saudi Ministry of Health General Hospitals","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":-1842233651,"_task_hash":10518585,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1557,"end":1560,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}

The aim of current study was to investigate whether functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FccR genes (FCGR) are associated with human asthma and allergy. Methods: Functional SNPs of FCGR2A (FccRIIA-131His.Arg, rs1801274), FCGR2B (FccRIIB-187Ile.Thr, rs1050501), FCGR2C (FccRIIC-13Gln.Stop, rs10917661), FCGR3A (FccRIIIA-158Val.Phe, rs396991), and FCGR3B variants (FccRIIIB NA1 and NA2) were genotyped in an asthma family cohort including 370 atopy positive, 239 atopy negative, and 169 asthma positive subjects. The genotype and phenotype data (asthma, bronchial hyper-responsiveness, and atopy) of subjects were analyzed using family-based association tests (FBAT) and logistic regression adjusted for age and sex. Result: The FccRIIA-131His.Arg SNP is significantly associated with atopy in a family-based association test (P = 0.00287) and in a logistic regression analysis (P = 0.0269, OR 0.732, 95% CI: 0.555-0.965). The FccRIIA-131His (or rs1801274-A) allele capable of binding human IgG2 has a protective role against atopy. In addition, the rare FccRIIB-187Thr (or rs1050501-C) allele defective for the receptor-mediated inhibitory signals is a risk factor for atopy (P = 0.0031, OR 1.758, 95% CI: 1.209-2.556) and IgE production (P,0.001). However, variants of activating FccRIIIA (rs396991), and FccRIIIB (NA1 and NA2), and FccRIIC (rs10917661) are not associated with asthma, BHR, and atopy (P.0.05).

{"text":"Millions of children are exposed to tuberculosis (TB) each year, many of which become infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most children can immunologically contain or eradicate the organism without pathology developing. However, in a minority, the organism overcomes the immunological constraints, proliferates and causes TB disease. Each year a million children develop TB disease, with a quarter dying. While it is known that young children and those with immunodeficiencies are at increased risk of progression from TB infection to TB disease, our understanding of risk factors for this transition is limited. The most immunologically disruptive process that can happen during childhood is infection with another pathogen and yet the impact of co-infections on TB risk is poorly investigated. Many diseases have overlapping geographical distributions to TB and affect similar patient populations. It is therefore likely that infection with viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa may impact on the risk of developing TB disease following exposure and infection, although disentangling correlation and causation is challenging. As vaccinations also disrupt immunological pathways, these may also impact on TB risk. In this article we describe the pediatric immune response to M. tuberculosis and then review the existing evidence of the impact of co-infection with other pathogens, as well as vaccination, on the host response to M. tuberculosis. We focus on the impact of other organisms on the risk of TB disease in children, in particularly evaluating if co-infections drive host immune responses in an age-dependent way. We finally propose priorities for future research in this field. An improved understanding of the impact of co-infections on TB could assist in TB control strategies, vaccine development (for TB vaccines or vaccines for other organisms), TB treatment approaches and TB diagnostics.","meta":{"paper_id":"4ce5891928816eb6068228ce463b91ed70df44e1","title":"Examining the Complex Relationship Between Tuberculosis and Other Infectious Diseases in Children","score":0.5,"pattern":0},"_input_hash":2075982940,"_task_hash":-1919279079,"spans":[{"text":"age","start":1612,"end":1615,"priority":0.5,"score":0.5,"pattern":-1300047199,"label":"RISK_FACTOR"}],"_session_id":null,"_view_id":"ner","answer":"accept"}
{"text":"Background: Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are reported to have similar risk factors and similar recommendations apply to manage infected cats. However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables.

Results: In the multivariable random intercept model, the odds of FIV compared to FeLV positive ELISA results were greater for adults (OR = 2.09, CI: 1.50-2.92), intact males (OR = 3.14, CI: 1.85-3.76), neutered males (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.44-3.14), cats with outdoor access (OR = 2.58, CI: 1.85-3.76) and lower for cats with clinical illness (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.90).

{"text":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a great public health concern globally. Although 83% of the globally confirmed cases have emerged in Saudi Arabia, the spatiotemporal clustering of MERS-CoV incidence has not been investigated. This study analysed the spatiotemporal patterns and clusters of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and March 2019. Temporal, seasonal, spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were performed using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest MERS-CoV infection risk. A strongly significant temporal cluster for MERS-CoV infection risk was identified between April 5 and May 24, 2014. Most MERS-CoV infections occurred during the spring season (41.88%), with April and May showing significant seasonal clusters. Wadi Addawasir showed a high-risk spatial cluster for MERS-CoV infection. The most likely high-risk MERS-CoV annual spatiotemporal clusters were identified for a group of cities (n = 10) in Riyadh province between 2014 and 2016. A monthly spatiotemporal cluster included Jeddah, Makkah and Taif cities, with the most likely high-risk MERS-CoV infection cluster occurring between April and May 2014. Significant spatiotemporal clusters of MERS-CoV incidence were identified in Saudi Arabia. The findings are relevant to control the spread of the disease. This study provides preliminary risk assessments for the further investigation of the environmental risk factors associated with MERS-CoV clusters. these included persons who handle live camels (e.g., camel workers, camel salesmen, camel shepherds, slaughterhouse workers, animal and waste transporters) and persons who administer medications to camels or clean camel medical equipment [6] [7] [8] . Nevertheless, most patients report no exposure to camels [9] . The global camel population is estimated at approximately 35 million camels [10]; of these, 95% are dromedary camels [11] . In Saudi Arabia, the camel is considered a national, socio-cultural heritage animal and is central in the livestock economy, as it is used for milk or meat and in a traditional race festival (locally known as Mazain al-Ibal) [12] . The number of camels in Saudi Arabia is estimated at more than 1.39 million heads [13] and has been growing annually by 5.2% since 1961 [10]. Information is lacking regarding the distribution of camels in Saudi Arabia. In June 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture launched an electronic system for numbering and tracking camels in order to create a database on them through the use of microchip implants [14] . This endeavor is a part of a wider initiative to control animal diseases and to create a database on each camel and its owner. The new project will help improve camel health and control the spread of zoonotic diseases. No permanent and sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed despite close contact with MERS-CoV-infected patients [15] . However, nosocomial transmission in healthcare facilities between patients and healthcare workers and between patients sharing spaces in healthcare facilities represents the main mode of human-to-human infection [16] . MERS-CoV outbreaks linked to healthcare settings have occurred in several countries, with the largest being in Saudi Arabia, especially in 2014 and 2015 [17] [18] [19] . This may be due to inadequate, inconsistent or incomplete compliance with infection prevention and control practices, limited isolation of suspected MERS-CoV patients and patient crowdedness [20] . Furthermore, household transmission was observed from patients to other household members, but this was less striking than other modes of transmission [15, 17, 18, 21] . In Saudi Arabia, the probable risk factors for MERS-CoV infection were older age [20, 22] , male sex [22] , exposure to dromedary camels, comorbidities and smoking [23] . For household transmission, the identified risk factors were sleeping in an index patient's room, removing a patient's waste or touching respiratory secretions [21] . The factors related to MERS-CoV mortality were mainly old age and the existence of underlying comorbidities [22, 24] . The spread of an infectious disease is an instance of spatiotemporal diffusion processes at work, in which the emergence of the disease moves across space and changes in extent over time [25] . Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26, 27] . Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28] . However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. However, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. A geo-additive regression model was also utilized to examine the risk factor levels of individuals for MERS-CoV mortality in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2015 [30], and significant spatial variation and clustering with a lower risk were found in Riyadh, Arar, Aljouf and Jizan, whereas a higher risk was observed in Qassim province. However, the spatial analysis lacked detail at the governorate and city levels. The application of an iterative empirical process in a GIS environment revealed that high-camel-density areas, camel convergence points (camel markets, barns, breeding sites and slaughterhouses), former MERS-CoV cases and high seroprevalence rates were the potential risk factors for spatial MERS-CoV hotspots in Kenya [31].

{"text":"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a great public health concern globally. Although 83% of the globally confirmed cases have emerged in Saudi Arabia, the spatiotemporal clustering of MERS-CoV incidence has not been investigated. This study analysed the spatiotemporal patterns and clusters of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia between June 2012 and March 2019. Temporal, seasonal, spatial and spatiotemporal cluster analyses were performed using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics to determine the time period and geographical areas with the highest MERS-CoV infection risk. A strongly significant temporal cluster for MERS-CoV infection risk was identified between April 5 and May 24, 2014. Most MERS-CoV infections occurred during the spring season (41.88%), with April and May showing significant seasonal clusters. Wadi Addawasir showed a high-risk spatial cluster for MERS-CoV infection. The most likely high-risk MERS-CoV annual spatiotemporal clusters were identified for a group of cities (n = 10) in Riyadh province between 2014 and 2016. A monthly spatiotemporal cluster included Jeddah, Makkah and Taif cities, with the most likely high-risk MERS-CoV infection cluster occurring between April and May 2014. Significant spatiotemporal clusters of MERS-CoV incidence were identified in Saudi Arabia. The findings are relevant to control the spread of the disease. This study provides preliminary risk assessments for the further investigation of the environmental risk factors associated with MERS-CoV clusters. these included persons who handle live camels (e.g., camel workers, camel salesmen, camel shepherds, slaughterhouse workers, animal and waste transporters) and persons who administer medications to camels or clean camel medical equipment [6] [7] [8] . Nevertheless, most patients report no exposure to camels [9] . The global camel population is estimated at approximately 35 million camels [10]; of these, 95% are dromedary camels [11] . In Saudi Arabia, the camel is considered a national, socio-cultural heritage animal and is central in the livestock economy, as it is used for milk or meat and in a traditional race festival (locally known as Mazain al-Ibal) [12] . The number of camels in Saudi Arabia is estimated at more than 1.39 million heads [13] and has been growing annually by 5.2% since 1961 [10]. Information is lacking regarding the distribution of camels in Saudi Arabia. In June 2019, the Saudi Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture launched an electronic system for numbering and tracking camels in order to create a database on them through the use of microchip implants [14] . This endeavor is a part of a wider initiative to control animal diseases and to create a database on each camel and its owner. The new project will help improve camel health and control the spread of zoonotic diseases. No permanent and sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed despite close contact with MERS-CoV-infected patients [15] . However, nosocomial transmission in healthcare facilities between patients and healthcare workers and between patients sharing spaces in healthcare facilities represents the main mode of human-to-human infection [16] . MERS-CoV outbreaks linked to healthcare settings have occurred in several countries, with the largest being in Saudi Arabia, especially in 2014 and 2015 [17] [18] [19] . This may be due to inadequate, inconsistent or incomplete compliance with infection prevention and control practices, limited isolation of suspected MERS-CoV patients and patient crowdedness [20] . Furthermore, household transmission was observed from patients to other household members, but this was less striking than other modes of transmission [15, 17, 18, 21] . In Saudi Arabia, the probable risk factors for MERS-CoV infection were older age [20, 22] , male sex [22] , exposure to dromedary camels, comorbidities and smoking [23] . For household transmission, the identified risk factors were sleeping in an index patient's room, removing a patient's waste or touching respiratory secretions [21] . The factors related to MERS-CoV mortality were mainly old age and the existence of underlying comorbidities [22, 24] . The spread of an infectious disease is an instance of spatiotemporal diffusion processes at work, in which the emergence of the disease moves across space and changes in extent over time [25] . Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a means to visualize, analyze and understand the distribution of infectious diseases over space and time, thereby revealing spatiotemporal trends, patterns and associations between the pathological factors and the geographic environments of the disease [26, 27] . Exploiting the analytical, modelling and simulation features of GIS has improved epidemiological outbreak investigation and response, in which recognizing the spatial spread and transmission dynamics of an emerging infectious disease is essential for advising on efficient disease control and prevention measures [28] . However, since the first reported case of MERS-CoV in 2012, there has been a paucity of studies addressing the spatial dimension of the distribution of this disease. With the use of ecological modelling in a GIS environment [29], a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors (bioclimatic variables). This suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role.

Methods: We defined a suspected case as onset of hematemesis between 1 June 2015 and 15 October 2015 in a resident of Hoima, Buliisa or neighbouring districts. We identified cases by reviewing medical records and actively searching in the community. We interviewed casepatients and health-care workers and performed descriptive epidemiology to generate hypotheses on possible exposures. In a case-control study we compared exposures between 21 cases and 81 controls, matched by age (\u00b1 10 years), sex and village of residence. We collected 22 biological specimens from 19 case-patients to test for Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers (VHF). We analysed the data using the Mantel-Haenszel method to account for the matched study design. Results: We identified 56 cases with onset from June to October (attack rate 15/100,000 in Buliisa District and 5.2/100,000 in Hoima District). The age-specific attack rate was highest in persons aged 31-60 years (15/100,000 in Hoima and 47/100,000 in Buliisa); no persons below 15 years of age had the illness.
